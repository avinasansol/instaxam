1Q Consider the following statements regarding Harshavardhana’s Kingdom
1. Kanauj gained importance as capital city due to increased flow of money compared to Pataliputra
2. Accounts of HiuenTsang provide the information about Harsha’s conquest in South India.
3. In later part of his life, Harsha converted to Hinayana Buddhism.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 3 only
(B)2 only
(C)3 only
(D)1 and 2 only
ANS: B
SOL:
Harsha made Kanauj the seat of his power and there from extended his authority in all directions. During this period Pataliputra fell on bad days and Kanauj came to the forefront.
How did this happen?
Pataliputra owed its power and importance to trade and commerce and the widespread use of money. Tolls could be collected from the traders who came to the city from the east west, north and south by means of four rivers.
But once money became scarce, trade declined, and officers and soldiers begun to be paid through land grants, the city lost its importance. Power shifted to military camps (skandhavaras), and places of strategic importance, which dominated long stretches of land, acquired prominence. To this class belonged Kanauj. Hence Statement 1 is incorrect.
The most important military campaign of Harsha was against the Western Chalukya ruler Pulakesin II. Both the accounts of Hiuen Tsang and the inscriptions of Pulakesin II provide the details of this campaign. Harsha with an ambition to extend his kingdom south of the Narmada river marched against the Chalukya ruler. But the Aiholeinscription of Pulakesin II mentions the defeat of Harsha byPulakesin. Hence statement 2 is correct.
In his early life, Harsha was a devoutSaiva but later he became an ardent HinayanaBuddhist. Hiuen Tsang converted him toMahayana Buddhism. Harsha prohibited the use of animal food in his kingdom and punished those who kill any living being.Hence statement 3 is incorrect.
2Q In Indian history, the term “Apana” is referred to
(A)Guilds
(B)Shopkeepers
(C)Artisans
(D)Chief merchant
ANS: B
SOL:
Types of Merchants
The Garland of Madurai calls the streets broad rivers of people who buy and sell in the marketplace. The importance of shopkeepers is indicated by the repetition of the term apanain the description of the city of Sakala. Its shops appear as filled with various types
of cloth made in Kashi, Kotumbara, and elsewhere.Hence, option (b) is correct.
Many artisans and merchants were organized into guilds called sreniandayatana, but how these organizations functioned is indicated neither in theMahavastunor in the Milinda-Panho. Both merchants and craftsmen were divided into high, low, and middle ranks.The Buddhist texts mention the sresthi, who was the chief merchant of thenigama, and the sarthavaha, the caravan leader who was the head of the corporation of merchants(vanijgramo). It also speaks of nearly half a dozen petty merchants called vanija. They dealt in fruits, roots, cooked food, sugar,bark cloth, sheaves of corn or grass, and bamboo. We also hear of many shopkeepers in a Tamil text. They sold sweet cakes, scented powder, fetal quids,and flower garlands. These merchants thus met the varied needs of the urban folk including food, clothing, and housing. To them we can add perfumers or all-purpose merchants called gandhika. Various types of oilmen, some of them dealing in perfumed oils, are covered by the term. The term vyavahari, that is,one who transacts business, is also used, but the term vyaparior trader seems tobe missing. The term agrivanija seems to be obscure, but these merchants may have been the predecessors of the agrawalas if we allow for some linguistic change. Whatever may be the meaning of this term, there were certainly wholesale merchants who conducted both internal and external trade.

But Porus refused and decided to fight against Alexander. Then Alexander marched from Taxila to the banks of the river Hydaspes (Jhelum). On the other side of the river he saw the vast army of Porus.Hence, option (a) is correct. As there were heavy floods in the river, Alexander was not able to cross it. After afew days, he crossed the river and the famous battle of Hydaspes was fought on the plains of Karri. It was a
well-contested battle.Although Porus had a strong army, he lost the battle. Alexander was impressed by the courage and heroism of this Indian prince,treated him generously and reinstated him on his throne.

SOL:
Society under the Pallavas
The Tamil society witnessed a great change during the Pallava period. The caste system became rigid. The Brahmins occupied a high place in the society. They were given land-grants by the kings and nobles.Hence statement 1 and 2 is correct.
They were also given the responsibility of looking after the temples. The Pallava period also witnessed the rise of Saivism and Vaishnavism and also the decline of Buddhism and Jainism. Hence statement 3 is incorrect.
The SaivaNayanmars and the Vaishnava Alwars contributed to the growth of Saivism and Vaishnavism. This is known as the Bhakti Movement. They composed their hymns in the Tamil language.
These hymns revealed the importance of devotion or Bakthi. The construction of temples by the Pallava kings paved the way for the spread of these two religions.

9Q Consider the following statements regarding the difference between sangam texts and Rig Veda 1. Sangam Literature does not constitute religious literature.
2. Sangam Literature is short and long poems were composed by numerous poets in praise of various heroes and heroines.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
The sangam texts are different from the Vedic texts, particularly the RigVeda. They do not constitute religious literature. The short and long poems were composed by numerous poets in praise of various heroes and heroines and are thus secular in nature. They are not primitive songs, but literature of high quality.Many poems mention a warrior or a chief or a king by name and describe in detail his military exploits. The gifts made by him to bards and warriors are celebrated. These poems may have been recited in the courts. They are compared with the heroic poetry of the Homeric age, for they represent a heroic age of warriors and battles. It is difficult to use these texts for historical purposes.Perhaps the proper names, titles, dynasties, territories, wars, and the like mentioned in the poems are partly real. Some of the Chera kings mentioned in the Sangam texts also appear as donors in inscriptions of the first and second centuries.
10Q Which one of the following edicts mentions the personal name of Ashoka?
(A)Taxila
(B)Lumbini
(C)Maski
(D)Kalinga Edict
ANS: C

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)2 only
(B)3 only
(C)1 and 2 only
(D)1 and 3 only
ANS: D
SOL:
The Gurjara-Pratiharas were the earliest of the Rajput rulers. Its first great leader was Harischandra. He conquered extensive territory in Rajputana and ruled with his capital at Bhinmal. The Gurjaras were in different branches. Hence statement 1 is correct.
One branch ruled Gujarat and another at Avanthi. The Pratiharas involved themselves in a three cornered contest with the Palas of Bengal and the Rashtrakutas of Deccan. Later the Pratiharas became weak. Hence statement 3 is correct.
The Chauhans, the most valiant of the Rajput races, ruled Ajmir. Vigraharaj was their most important king, who occupied Delhi. Therefore the Chauhans faced the onslaught of the Muslims under Muhammad of Ghori. The Paramaras were also important Rajput rulers of this period. The most important king was Bhoja. His military conquests as well as cultural contributions remain notable in the history of Rajputs. Constant fighting weakened the Rajputs. Also, they never united against a common enemy.Hence statement 2 is incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
The Chola kingdom, which came to be called Cholamandalam (Coromandel),in early medieval times, was situated to the north-east of the territory of thePandyas, between the Pennar and the Velar rivers. We have some idea of the political history of the Cholas from the Sangam texts. Their chief centre of political power laid at Uraiyur,a place famous for cotton trade.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect. It seems that in the mid-second century BC, a Chola king named Elara conquered Sri Lanka and ruled over it for nearly fifty years. A clearer history of the Cholas begins in the second century AD with their famous king Karikala. He founded Puhar and constructed 160 km of embankment along the Kaveri river. This was built with the labour of 12,000 slaves who were brought as captives from Sri Lanka. Puharis coterminous with Kaveripattinam, the Chola capital. It was a great centre of trade and commerce, and excavations show that it had a large dock. One of the principal sources of the wealth of the Cholas was trade in cotton cloth. They maintained an efficient navy.

ANS: C
SOL:
Both the statements are correct.
Rajendra I (1012-1044 A.D.)
Rajendra had demonstrated his military ability by participating in his father’s campaigns. He continued his father’s policy of aggressive conquests and expansion. His important wars were:
1. Mahinda V, the king of Sri Lanka attempted to recover from the Cholas the northern part of Ceylon. Rajendra defeated him and seized southern Sri Lanka. Thus the whole of Sri Lanka was made part of the Chola Empire.
2. He reasserted the Chola authority over the Chera and Pandya countries. 3. He defeated Jayasimha II, the Western Chalukya king and the river Tungabadhra was recognized as the boundary between the Cholas and Chalukyas.
4. His most famous military enterprise was his expedition to north
India. The Chola army crossed the Ganges by defeating a number of rulers on its way. Rajendra defeated Mahipala I of Bengal.
To commemorate this successful north-Indian campaign Rajendra founded the city ofGangaikondacholapuram and constructed the famous Rameswaram temple in that city. He also excavated a large irrigation tank called Cholagangam on the western side of the city.

The Fifteenth Finance Commission was constituted on 27 November 2017 against the backdrop of the abolition of Planning Commission (as also of the distinction between Plan and non-Plan expenditure) and the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST), which has fundamentally redefined federal fiscal relations.
The 15th Finance Commission used the following criteria while determining the share of states: (i) 45% for the income distance, (ii) 15% for the population in 2011, (iii) 15% for the area, (iv) 10% for forest and ecology, (v) 12.5% for demographic performance, and (vi) 2.5% for tax effort.
The Terms of Reference of the Finance Commission require it to recommend grants-in-aid to the States. These grants include: (i) revenue deficit grants, (ii) grants to local bodies, and (iii) disaster management grants.

(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Sungas
The founder of the Sunga dynasty was Pushyamitra Sunga,who was the commander-in chief under the Mauryas. Heassassinated the last Mauryan ruler and usurped the throne. The most important challenge to the Sunga rule was to protect northIndia against the invasions of the Bactrian Greeks from the northwest.
The Greeks advanced up to Pataliputra and occupied it for some time.However, Pushyamitra succeeded in regaining the lost territory. He also fought a campaign against Kharavela of Kalingawho invaded north India.
Pushyamitra was a staunch follower of Brahmanism. Heperformed two asvamedha sacrifices. Buddhist sources refer to him as a persecutor of Buddhism. But there is enough evidence to show that Pushyamitrapatronised Buddhist art.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect. During his reign theBuddhist monuments at Bharhut and Sanchi were renovated and further improved.
After the death of Pushyamitra, his son Agnimitra became the ruler. The last Sunga ruler was Devabhuti, who was murdered by his minister Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of the Kanva dynasty.
The Kanva dynasty ruled for 45 years. After the fall of the Kanvas,the history of Magadha was blank until the establishment of the Gupta dynasty.

Asoka’s Dhamma
Although Asoka embraced Buddhism and took efforts to spread Buddhism, his policy of Dhamma was a still broad concept.It was a way of life, a code of conduct and a set of principles to be adopted and practiced by the people at large. His principles ofDhamma were clearly stated in his Edicts. The main features ofAsoka’s Dhamma as mentioned in his various Edicts may be summed as follows:
1. Service to father and mother, practice of ahimsa, love of truth,reverence to teachers and good treatment of relatives.
2. Prohibition of animal sacrifices and festive gatherings and avoiding expensive and meaningless ceremonies and rituals.

29Q Consider the following statements
1. Under the leadership of Churaman, Jats acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi in late sixteenth century
2. Marathas were largely known for their endless military campaigns.
3. Marathas once controlled parts of present day Punjab and Rajasthan.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)2 only
(B)3 only
(C)1 and 2 only
(D)2 and 3 only
ANS: D
SOL:
Like the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. Hence Statement 1 is incorrect.
Between 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized
from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.
After raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south. Hence Statement 3 is correct.
These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.

Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well.Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwadof Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies.

(A)1 and 2 only
(B)1 and 3 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
The judicial system was far more developed under the Guptas than in earlier times. Several law-books were compiled during this period, and for the first time civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Theft and adultery fall under criminal law, disputes regarding various types of property under civil law.
Elaborate laws were laid down about inheritance. As in earlier times, many laws continued to be based on varna differentiation. It was the duty of the king to uphold the law, and try cases with the help of brahmana priests. The guilds of artisans, merchants, and others were governed by their own laws. Seals fromVaishali and from Bihta near Allahabad indicate that these guilds flourished during Gupta times.
The Gupta bureaucracy was not as elaborate as that of the Mauryas.Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
The most important officers in the Gupta empire were the kumaramatyas. They were appointed by the king in the home provinces and possibly paid in cash.
31Q Consider the following statements regardingKushans
1. The early Kushan kings issued numerous gold coins with a higher degree of metallic purity than is found in the Gupta gold coins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
The house of Kadphises was succeeded by that of Kanishka. Its kings extended Kushan power over upper India and the lower Indus basin. The earlyKushan kings issued numerous gold coins with a higher degree of metallic purity than is found in the Gupta gold coins. Although the gold coins of the Kushans are found mainly west of the Indus, their inscriptions are distributed not only innorth-western India and Sindh but also in Mathura, Shravasti, Kaushambi, andVaranasi. Hence, besides the Ganga– Yamuna doab they had established their authority in the greater part of the middle Gangetic basin. Kushan coins,inscriptions, constructions, and pieces of sculpture found in Mathura show that itwas their second capital in India, the first being Purushapura or Peshawar, whereKanishka erected a monastery and a huge stupa or relic tower which excited the wonder of foreign travelers.
Kanishka was the most famous Kushan ruler. Although outside the borders ofIndia, he seems to have suffered defeat at the hands of the Chinese, he is knownto history for two reasons. First, he started an era in AD 78, which isnow known as the Shaka era and is used by the Government of India.Secondly, Kanishkaextended his wholehearted patronage to Buddhism. He held a Buddhist councilin Kashmir, where the doctrines of the Mahayana form of Buddhism werefinalized. Kanishka was also a great patron of art and architecture. Kanishka’ssuccessors continued to rule in north-western India till about AD 230, and someof them bore a typical Indian name such as Vasudeva.

1. Chinese pangolin has been listed as “critically endangered”.
2. Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) has been listed as “endangered”. It is also a Schedule I category protected animal, under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
In June 2020, China increased protection for the native Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) to the highest level, which closed an important loophole for consumption of the species in-country. Additionally, the government will no longer allow the use of pangolin scales in traditional medicine, a big win given that an estimated 195,000 pangolins were trafficked in 2019 for their scales alone.

Similarly, weavers such as the Saliyar or Kaikkolars emerged as prosperous communities, making donations to temples. Some aspects of cloth making like cotton cleaning, spinning and dyeing became specialised and independent crafts.
The architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels.
In its heyday in the fifteenth sixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi.
Temples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis(temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important
festivals celebrated at Hampi.
Surat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (present day Khambhat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad.
Surat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca Because many pilgrim ships set sail from here.
The city was cosmopolitan and people of all castes and creeds lived there. In the seventeenth century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and warehouses at Surat. According to the English chronicler Ovington who wrote an account of the port in 1689, on average a hundred ships of different countries could be found anchored at the port at any given time.

However, in the north-western part of the subcontinent they appeared in Aramaic language and Kharosthi script, and inAfghanistan they were written in both Aramaic and Greek scripts and languages.Hence, option (d) is correct.
He was the first Indian king to speak directly to the people through his inscriptions which carry royal orders. The inscriptions throw light onAshoka’scareer, his external and domestic policies, and the extent of his empire.
47Q With respect to Mughal India, IbadatKhana was
(A)A drum house from where ceremonial music was played in Mughal palaces
(B)A prayer hall indicating the direction of Mecca
(C)The discussion hall for secret courtly affairs in the Mughal palaces
(D)Meeting house to discuss the teachings of the various religious leaders.
ANS: D
SOL:
The IbādatKhāna was a meeting house built in 1575 CE by the Mughal Emperor
Akbar at FatehpurSikri to gather spiritual leaders of different religious grounds so as to conduct a discussion on the teachings of the respective religious leaders.
In his eagerness to learn about different religions, Akbar built a call of prayer at Fatehpur Sikri in 1575 known as the IbadatKhana. At this place, he invited selected mystics, intellectuals and theologians, and held discussions on religious and spiritual themes.
He invited scholars belonging to various religion such as Hinduism, Islam , Zoroastrianism , Christianity and even atheists. He conducted religious debates with these people. They visited IbadatKhana and discussed their religious belief with Akbar. The result of these discussions at the Hall of Prayer led them to the conclusion that all religions lead to the same goal.
48Q Consider the following statements regarding the Coral Triangle:
1. It is a marine area located in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
2. Nearly,95 % percent of the world’s coral species are found here.

The Coral Triangle is a marine area located in the western Pacific Ocean. It includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Solomon Islands.
The Coral Triangle hosts an astonishing amount of marine life. Seventy-five percent of the world’s coral species are found here—nearly 600 different species. Over 2000 different types of reef fish find refuge in these dazzling underwater gardens, and this is an important place for tuna to spawn. Whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs and whale sharks feed, breed and migrate in these waters. And the Coral Triangle is home to six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles.

49Q Consider the following statements regardingMaurya dynasty
1. The Maurya dynasty was founded by Chandragupta Maurya.
2. The machinations of Chanakya against Chandragupta’s enemies are described in detail in the Mudrarakshasa, a play written by Vishakhadatta.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
The Maurya dynasty was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, who seems to have belonged to an ordinary family. According to the Brahmanical tradition, he was born of Mura, a shudra woman in the court of the Nandas. However, an earlierBuddhist tradition speaks of the
Mauryas were the ruling clan of the little republic of Pipphalivana in the region of Gorakhpur near the Nepalese terai. In all likelihood, Chandragupta was a member of this clan. He took advantage of theNandas in the last days of their rule. With the help of Chanakya, who is known as Kautilya, he overthrew the Nandas and established the rule of the Mauryadynasty. The machinations of Chanakya against Chandragupta’s enemies are described in detail in the Mudrarakshasa, a play written by Vishakhadatta in the ninth century. In modern times, several plays have been based on it.
50Q In Harappan civilization, water reservoirs were found at
(A)Harappa
(B)Mohenjodaro
(C)Shortughai
(D)Dholavira
ANS: D
SOL:
Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid lands, where irrigation was probably required for agriculture. Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan, but not in Punjab or Sind. It is possible that ancient canals silted up long ago. It is also likely that water drawn from wells was used for irrigation. Besides,water reservoirs found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may have been used to store water for agriculture.Hence, option (d) is correct.

(A)An important military commander during Akbar reign.
(B)An official historian of the reign of Shahjahan.
(C)An important noble and confidant of Aurangzeb.
(D)A chronicler and poet during the reign of Muhammad Shah
ANS: B

52Q Consider the following statements regarding the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT): 1. Unlike other tribunals, CAT was constituted in the original constitution.
2. The CAT is not bound by the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code of 1908 but guided by the principles of natural justice.
3. Appeals against the orders of the CAT could be made only in the Supreme Court.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)3 only
(C)2 only
(D)None
ANS: C
SOL:
Article 323 A empowers the Parliament to provide for the establishment of administrative tribunals for the adjudication of disputes relating to
recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services of the Centre, the states, local bodies, public corporations and other public authorities.
In pursuance of Article 323 A, the Parliament has passed the
Administrative Tribunals Act in 1985. The act authorises the Central
government to establish one Central administrative tribunal and the state
administrative tribunals.
The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) was set up in 1985 with the principal bench at Delhi and additional benches in different states.
Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The CAT exercises original jurisdiction in relation to recruitment and all service matters of public servants covered by it. Its jurisdiction extends to the all-India services, the Central civil services, civil posts under the Centre and civilian employees of defence services. However, the members of the defence forces, officers and servants of the Supreme Court and the secretarial staff of the Parliament are not covered by it
The CAT is not bound by the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code of 1908. It is guided by the principles of natural justice. These
principles keep the CAT flexible in approach.
Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Originally, appeals against the orders of the CAT could be made only in the Supreme Court and not in the high courts. However, in the Chandra Kumar case (1997), the
The Supreme Court declared this restriction on the jurisdiction of the high courts as unconstitutional, holding that judicial review is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. It laid down that appeals against the orders of the CAT shall lie before the division bench of the concerned high court. Consequently, now it is not possible for an aggrieved public servant to approach the Supreme Court directly against an order of the CAT, without first going to the concerned high court.
Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

53Q Consider the following statements regarding the administration of Mughals
1. The mansabdars military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawaror cavalrymen.
2. Most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
Both the statements are correct.
As the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars.
The term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble’s position in court and the larger his salary.
The mansabdars military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawaror cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary.
Most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs.
54Q Consider the following statements regarding urban planning during Harappan periods 1. The Citadel owes its height to the fact that buildings were constructed on mud brick platforms. 2. Both the Citadel and the Lower Town were walled.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
Perhaps the most unique feature of the Harappan Civilization was the development of urban centres.Let us look at one such centre, Mohenjodaro,
more closely. Although Mohenjodaro is the most well-known site, the first site to be discovered was Harappa.
The settlement is divided into two sections, one smaller but higher and the other much larger but lower. Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel and the Lower Town respectively. The Citadel owes its height to the fact that buildings were constructed on mud brick platforms. It was walled, which meant that it was physically separated from theLower Town.
The Lower Town was also walled. Several buildings were built on platforms, which served as foundations.It has been calculated that if one labourer movedroughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the foundations in place it would have required four million person-days, in other words, mobilizing labour on a very large scale.

This had increased his power and prestige. This war lasted for about sixteen years. It was at this time that Ajatasatrurealised the strategic importance of the small village, Pataligrama (future Pataliputra). He fortified it to serve as a convenient base of operations against Vaisali.Buddhists and Jains both claim that Ajatasatru was a follower of their religion. But it is generally believed that in the beginning he was a follower of Jainism and subsequently embraced Buddhism.
He is said to have met Gautama Buddha. This scene is also depicted in the sculptures of Bharhut. According to the Mahavamsa, reconstructed several chaityas and viharas. He was also instrumental in convening the First Buddhist Council at Rajagriha soon after the death of the Buddha.

57Q Consider the following statements regarding Ahoms
1. They migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. 2. Mughals defeated Ahoms and established direct control over the region for a longer period of time.
3. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the1530s.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 3 only
(B)2 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans(landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make high quality gunpowder and cannons. Hence Statement 3 is correct.
However, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. Hence Statement 2 is incorrect.
58Q Consider the following statements regardingPolitical Organization during later Vedic times
1. The vidatha completely disappeared.
2. Sabha and Samiti were dominated by warriors and brahmanas.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
In later Vedic times, the Rig Vedic tribal assemblies lost importance, and royal power increased at their cost. The vidatha completely disappeared; the sabha and samiti continued to hold their ground but their character changed.They were now controlled by chiefs and rich nobles, and women were no longer permitted to sit in the sabha which was now dominated by warriors and brahmanas.
The formation of larger kingdoms increased the power of the chief or king.Tribal authority tended to become territorial. The dominant tribes gave their names to territories which might be inhabited by tribes other than their own.
Initially each area was named after the tribe that first settled there. First Panchali was the name of a people, and then it became the name of a region. The term rashtra, which indicates
territory, first arose during this period. The concept of controlling people also appeared. It was indicated by the use of the term rajya,which meant sovereign power.
Traces of the election of the king appear in later Vedic texts. The individual considered to have the best in physical and other attributes was elected raja. A tribal who pioneered settlements, showed skill in farming, and fought bravely was elected the chief of his tribe. This may have been the case with the raja. Hereceived voluntary presents called bali from his ordinary kinsmen or the common people called the vis. Gradually these voluntary presents assumed the form of tributes that were forcibly collected. The ruler, however, sought to perpetuate the right to receive presents and enjoy other privileges pertaining to his office by making it hereditary in his family, the post generally going to the eldest son. However, this succession was not always smooth. The Mahabharata tells us that Duryodhana, the younger cousin of Yudhishthira, usurped power.
Battling for territory, the families of the Pandavas and Kauravas virtually destroyed themselves. The Bharata battle shows that kingship knows no kinship.
59Q Consider the following statements
1. During the seventeenth century two new crops, namely, tobacco and maize were introduced in India.
2. Salt and sugar were way cheaper and Ghee and oil were more expensive. 3. The Coromandel coast became a centre of textile production
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)3 only
(B)2 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)None
ANS: C
SOL:
A large variety of crops such as wheat, rice, gram, barley, pulses were
cultivated. Commercial crops such as cotton, indigo, sugarcane and
oil-seeds were also cultivated. During the seventeenth century two new crops, namely, tobacco and maize were added. Potato and red chillies came later in the eighteenth century. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
It might be due to the high cost of leather.Rice, millets and pulses were the staple food of the common people.Fish was popular in the coastal region. While ghee and oil were cheaper, salt and sugar were more expensive. As plenty of cattle are kept by the rural people, milk and milk products were available
in plenty.Hence Statement 2 is incorrect.

Bengal exported sugar, rice as well as delicate muslin and silk. The Coromandel coast became a centre of textile production.Gujarat was an entry point of foreign goods. From there, fine textiles and silk were taken to north India. Indigo and food grains were exported from north India through Gujarat.Hence Statement 3 is correct.
60Q Consider the following statements regarding the International Comparison Program (ICP): 1. It is managed by the World Bank under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Commission.
2. One of the main objectives of the program is to convert volume and per capita measures of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components into a common currency using PPPs.
3. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is the National Implementing Agency (NIA) for India.

(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
All the statements given above are correct.
International Comparison Program (ICP)
The ICP is one of the largest statistical initiatives in the world. It is managed by the World Bank under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Commission, and relies on a partnership of international, regional, sub-regional, and national agencies working under a robust governance framework and following an established statistical methodology.
The main objectives of the ICP are to:
(i) produce purchasing power parities (PPPs) and comparable price level indexes (PLIs) for participating economies;
(ii) convert volume and per capita measures of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components into a common currency using PPPs.
PPPs are calculated based on the price of a common basket of goods and services in each participating economy and are a measure of what an economy’s local currency can buy in another economy. Market exchange rate-based conversions reflect both price and volume differences in expenditures and are thus inappropriate for volume comparisons. PPP-based

conversions of expenditures eliminate the effect of price level differences between economies and reflect only differences in the volume of economies.
India has participated in almost all ICP rounds since its inception in 1970.The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is National Implementing Agency (NIA) for India, which has the responsibility of planning, coordinating and implementing national ICP activities.India has also been a co-Chair of the ICP Governing Board along with Statistics Austria for the ICP 2017 cycle.

2. It was the battle that the Bharatas fought with the host of ten chiefs, all of them being non Aryan people.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
The Indo-Aryans were engaged in two types of conflicts. First, they fought with the pre-Aryans, and secondly, they fought amongst themselves. Intra-tribal conflicts rocked the Aryan communities for a long time. According to tradition,the Aryans were divided into five tribes called panchajana, but there might have been other tribes too. The Aryans fought amongst themselves and sometimes enlisted the support of the non-Aryan peoples for the purpose. The Bharatas and the Tritsu were the ruling Aryan clans, and they were supported by priestVasishtha. The country Bharatavarsha was eventually named after the tribe Bharata, which is first mentioned in the RigVeda. The Bharata ruling clan was opposed by a host of ten chiefs, five of whom were heads of Aryan tribes and the remaining five of the non Aryan people. The battle that the Bharatas fought with the host of ten chiefs is known as the Battle of Ten Kings. It was fought on the river Parushni, coterminous with the river Ravi, and it gave victory to Sudas and established the supremacy of the Bharatas.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect. Of the defeated tribes, the most important was that of the Purus. Subsequently, the Bharatas joined hands with the Purus and formed a new ruling tribe called
the Kurus. The Kurus combined with the Panchalas, and they together established their rule in the upper Gangetic Basin where they played an important role in later Vedic times.
63Q Consider the following statements
1. Bandagan were the special slaves appointed by Delhi Sultans for military service.
2. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas
3. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was inheritable.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)2 only
ANS: A
SOL:
The consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandaganin
Persian. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them.
Like the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadaror muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary.They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office is not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted.Hence Statement 3 is incorrect.

65Q Consider the following statements regarding Harappan script
1. Most inscriptions are long.
2. The script was written from right to left.
3. The script has too many signs – somewhere between 375 and 400.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)1 and 3 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: C
SOL:
An enigmatic script
Harappan seals usually have a line of writing,probably containing the name and title of the owner.Scholars have also suggested that the motif(generally an animal) conveyed a meaning to those who could not read.
Most inscriptions are short, the longest containing about 26 signs. Hence, statement 1
is incorrect.
Although the script remain undeciphered to date, it was evidently not alphabetical (where each sign stands for a vowel ora consonant) as it has just too many signs –somewhere between 375 and 400. It is apparent that the script was written from right to left as some seals show a wider spacing on the right and cramping on the left, as if the engraver began working from the right and then ran out of space.
66Q Consider the following statements.
1. The formation of sub-national units were started during sixth century

(D)3 only
ANS: A
SOL:
In about the sixth-seventh centuries started the formation of sub-national units such as Andhra, Assam, Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, etc. Hence statement 1 is correct.
The identity of the sub-national groups is recognized by both foreign and Indian sources. The Chinese traveler Hsuan Tsang mentions several nationalities Visakhadatta, an author of about the sixth century AD., speaks of different regions inhabited by peoples’ differences in customs, clothing and language.
The Jaina books of the late eighth century notice the existence of 18 inajoz peoples or nationalities. It describes the physical features of 16, It produces samples of their language and says something about their character.
From the seventh century A.D the Bhakti cult spread throughout the country, and especially in the south Bhakti meant that people made all kinds of offerings to the god in return (or which they received the prasadao the favóur of the gods It meant that the devotees completely surrendered to their god. Hence statement 3 is correct.
This practice can be compared to the complete dependence of the tenants on the landowners. Just as the tenants offered and rendered various services to the lord and then received land and protection as a kind of favour from him, a similar relation carne to’ be established
between the individual and his god.
Social Crisis and the Origin of Land Grants
The central factor that ultimately transformed the ancient Indian society into medieval society was the practice of land grants. Hence Statement 2 is incorrect.
Why did this practice originate?
The charters say that the givers, mainly kings, wanted to açquire religious merit, and the receivers, mainly monks and priests, needed means for performing religious rites But the practice really came into being because of a serious crisis fiat affected the ancient social order
67Q Consider the following statements regardingMahajanapadas

The sixteen mahajanapadas
EarlyBuddhist and Jaina texts mention, amongst other things, sixteen states known as mahajanapadas.Although the lists vary,some names such as Vajji, Magadha, Koshala,Kuru, Panchala, Gandhara and Avanti occur frequently. Clearly, these were amongst the most important mahajanapadas.
While most mahajanapadas were ruled by kings,some, known as ganador sanghas, were oligarchies, where power was shared by a number of men, often collectively called rajas. Both Mahavira And the Buddha belonged to such ganas.In some instances, as in the case of the Vajjisangha,the rajas probably controlled resources such as land collectively. Although their histories are often difficult to reconstruct due to the lack of sources, some of these states lasted for nearly a thousand years.Each mahajanapada had a capital city, which is often fortified. Maintaining these fortified cities as well as providing for incipient armies and bureaucracies required resources.

Major political changes were taking place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when significant areas of northern India were under Muslim rule. Alauddin Khilji, the Sultan of
Delhi, was determined to bring South India under his domain and sent his commander, Malik Kafur, on a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital Devagiri in 1311. The Hoysala capital Halebidu was sacked twice, in 1311 and 1327.
71Q Which of the following goods were exported to Rome
1. Iron goods
2. Spices
3. Wine
4. Lead
Select the correct answer using the code given below
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)1 and 4 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2and 4 only
ANS: A
SOL:
Although the volume of trade between India and Rome seems to have been large, it was not conducted in articles of daily use for the common people. There Was a brisk commerce in luxury goods, which are sometimes called articles of aristocratic necessities. The Romans first started trade with the southernmost part of India, as their earliest coins are found in the Tamil kingdoms which layoutside the Satavahana dominions. The Romans mainly imported spices for which south India was famous, and also muslin, pearls, jewels, and precious stones from central and south India. Iron goods, especially cutlery, formed an important item of export to the Roman empire. Pearls, ivory, precious stones,and animals were considered luxuries, but plants and plant products served the basic religious, funerary, culinary, and medicinal needs of the people.

Kitchenware may have been included in the items of import, and cutlery may have been important for the higher class of people.
In return for the articles exported by India to the Roman Empire, the Romans Exported to India wine, wine-amphorae, and various other types of pottery which were discovered in excavations at Tamluk in West Bengal, Arikamedu nearPondicherry, and at several other sites in south India. Sometimes Roman gods travelled as far as Guwahati. Lead, which was used for making coins by theSatavahanas, seems to have been imported from Rome in the form of coiledstrips.
Hence, statements 3 and 4are incorrect.
72Q Consider the following statements regarding the real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test:
1. RT–PCR is used for those pathogens containing RNA that needs to be transcribed to DNA for amplification
2. Real time RT–PCR cannot be used to detect past infections.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
Both the statements given above are correct.
Real time RT–PCR is a nuclear-derived method for detecting the presence of specific genetic material in any pathogen, including a virus.
Real time RT–PCR is one of the most widely used laboratory methods for detecting the COVID-19 virus.
Some viruses such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, only contain RNA, which means that they rely on infiltrating healthy cells to multiply and survive.
In order for a virus like the COVID-19 virus to be detected early in the body using real time RT–PCR, scientists need to convert the RNA to DNA. This is a process called ‘reverse transcription’. They do this because only DNA can be copied — or amplified — which is a key part of the real time RT–PCR process for detecting viruses.
The real time RT–PCR technique is highly sensitive and specific and can deliver a reliable diagnosis in as little as three hours, though laboratories take on average between six and eight hours. Compared to other available virus isolation methods, real time RT–PCR is significantly faster and has a lower potential for contamination or errors, as the entire process can be carried out within a closed tube. It continues to be the most accurate method available for the detection of the COVID-19 virus.
However, real time RT–PCR cannot be used to detect past infections, which is important for understanding the development and spread of the virus, as viruses are only present in the body for a specific window of time.
RT–PCR is a variation of PCR, or polymerase chain reaction. The two techniques use the same process except that RT–PCR has an added step of reverse transcription of RNA to DNA, or RT, to allow for amplification. This means PCR is used for pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, that already contain DNA for amplification, while RT–PCR is
used for those containing RNA that needs to be transcribed to DNA for amplification.
PCR is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests for detecting pathogens, including viruses, that cause diseases such as Ebola, African swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. Since the COVID-19 virus only contains RNA, real time or conventional RT–PCR is used to detect it.

73Q Consider the following statements regardingSatavahana kings
#10119
1. The names of Satavahana rulers were derived from that of the mother.
2. The succession to the throne was generally matrilineal.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Names of Satavahana kings from inscriptions
These are the names of several generations ofSatavahana rulers, recovered from inscriptions. Notethe uniform title raja. Also note the following word,which ends with the term puta, a Prakrit word meaning“son”. The term Gotami-puta means “son of Gotami”.Names like Gotami and Vasithi are feminine forms ofGotama and Vasistha, Vedic seers after whom gotraswere named.
Satavahana rulers were identified through metronymics (names derived from that of the mother). Although this may suggest that mothers are important, we need to be cautious before we arrive at any conclusion. In the case of theSatavahanas we know that succession to the throne was generally patrilineal.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
74Q Rudrama Devi, one of the few queens in the Indian History, belongs to which of the following dynasties?
(A)Kakatiya Dynasty
(B)Rashtrakutas
(C)Cheras
(D)Pandyas
ANS: A
SOL:
Rudrama Devi, also known as Rudramadevi, reigned around 1262–1289 CE (alternative dates: 1261–1295 CE) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. She belongs to the Kakatiya dynasty.
About Kakatiya Dynasty
The Kakatiya dynasty was a South Indian dynasty whose capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal. It was eventually conquered by the Delhi Sultanate. The demise of Kakatiya dynasty resulted in confusion and anarchy under alien rulers for sometime, before the Musunuri Nayaks brought stability to the region
75Q Vikramankadevacharita was written by
(A)Atula
(B)Sandhyakara Nandi
(C)Bilhana
(D)Kalhana
ANS: C
SOL:
Indians Display a considerable historical sense in biographical writings, a good example of which is the composition of the Harshacharita by Banabhatta in the seventh century. It is a semi biographical work written in an ornate style which became the despair of later imitators. It describes the early career ofHarshavardhana. Although highly exaggerated, it gives an excellent idea of courtlife under Harsha and the social and religious life in his age. Later, several other charities or biographies were written.Sandhyakar Nandi’s Ramacharita(twelfth century) narrates the story of the conflict between the Kaivarta peasants and thePala prince Ramapala, resulting in the latter’s victory. Bilhana’sVikramankadevacharitarecounts the achievements of his patron, VikramadityaVI (1076–1127), the Chalukya king of Kalyan.Hence, option (c) is correct. Even the biographies (charita) of some merchants of Gujarat were written in AD twelfth–thirteenth centuries.
Similar historical works may have been written in south India, but thus far only one such account has been discovered. This is called MushikaVamshaand was written by Atula in the eleventh century. It is an account of the dynasty of theMushikas which ruled in northern
Kerala. However, the best example of the earliest historical writing is provided by the Rajataranginior The Stream ofKings written by Kalhana in the twelfth century. It is a string of biographies of the kings of Kashmir, and can be considered to be the first work to possess several characteristics of historical writing as it is understood today.

(A)1, 2 and 3 only
(B)2, 3 and 4 only
(C)1, 2 and 4 only
(D)1, 2, 3 and 4
ANS: D
SOL:
The Lower Palaeolithic or the Early Old Stone Age covers the greater part of the ice age. The Early Old Stone Age may have begun in Africa around two million years ago, but in India it is not older than 600,000 years. This date is given to Bori in Maharashtra, and this site is considered to be the earliest Lower Paleolithic site. People use hand axes, cleavers, and choppers. The Axes found in India are more or less similar to those of western Asia, Europe, and Africa.Stone tools were used largely for chopping, digging, and skinning. Early OldStone Age sites have been found in the valley of river Son or Sohan in Punjab,now in Pakistan. Several sites have been found in Kashmir and the Thar Desert.
Lower Paleolithic tools have also been found in the Belan valley in UP and in the desert area of Didwana in Rajasthan. Didwana yielded not only LowerPaleolithic stone tools but also those of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic ages.
Chirki-Nevasa in Maharashtra has yielded as many as 2000 tools, and those have also been found at several places in the south. Nagarjunakonda in AndhraPradesh is an important site, and the caves and rock shelters of Bhimbetka nearBhopal also show features of the Lower Paleolithic age. The rock shelters may have served as seasonal camps for human beings. Hand axes have been found ina deposit of the time of the second Himalayan interglaciation, when the climate became less humid. The people of the Lower Stone Age seem to have principally been food gatherers. They took to small game hunting and lived also on fish and birds. The Early or Lower Stone Age in India may be associated with the people of the Homo sapiens group.
Hence, option (d) is correct.
79Q Consider the following statements regarding Nomadic communities living in Medieval India

(A)1 and 3 only
(B)2 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)3 only
ANS: C
SOL:
The Banjaras were the most important trade nomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khilji used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.Hence Statement 1 is incorrect.
Tribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. Hence Statement 3is correct.
The large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained hunter-gatherers.Hence Statement 2is correct.

81Q Consider the following statements regardingChalcolithic period
1. It was the period when copper and bronze came to be used.
2. The use of stone tools was given up.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Metal Age
The Neolithic period is followed by the Chalcolithic (copper-stone)period when copper and bronze came to be used. The new technology of smelting metal ore and crafting metal artifacts is an important development in human civilization. But the use of stone tools was not given up.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect. Some of the microlithic tools continued to be essential items. People began to travel for a long distance to obtain metal ores. This led to a network of Chalcolithic cultures and the Chalcolithic cultures were found in many parts of India.
Generally, Chalcolithic cultures had grown in river valleys.Most importantly, the Harappan culture is considered as a part ofChalcolithic culture. In South India the river valleys of the
Godavari,Krishna,Tungabhadra, Pennar and Kaveri were settled by farming communities during this period. Although they were not using metals in the beginning of the Metal Age, there is evidence of copper and bronze artifacts by the end of the second millennium B.(C) Several bronze and copper objects, beads, terracotta figurines and pottery were found at Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu.
82Q Consider the following statements regarding Rig Veda
1. The term go (cow) occurs 176 times and no other animal is mentioned so frequently. 2. Vedic people frequently pray for praja (children) and pasu (cattle).
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
The term asva(horse) in theRig Veda and its cognates appears in Sanskrit, Avestan, Greek, Latin, and otherIndo-European languages.
In its various forms, the term asva occurs 215 times in the Rig Veda; no other animal is mentioned so frequently.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The term go (cow) occurs 176 times, and the term vrishabha(bull) 170 times.Both these terms taken together suggest the importance of cattle rearing.However, the cattle rearers were dominated by a horse-based aristocracy. The Tiger and rhinoceros, characteristic of the tropical and moderately temperate climate of India, are absent in the cold conditions of Central Asia. They don't occur in the Rig Veda, and similar other tropical and moderately temperate zone animals such as the lion, deer, buffalo, and elephant have few references in this text in contrast to those made to the horse, cow, and bull. This difference can be attributed to the Central Asian influence on the Rig Veda.
The Rig Veda devotes two complete hymns in praise of the horse. Almost all the Vedic gods are associated with it, and this in particular applies to Indra And His companions, the Maruts. Though the Vedic people frequently pray for praja(children) and pasu(cattle), they also specifically ask for horses, sometimes as many as a thousand.

The Act empowers the central government to control the production, supply, distribution, trade, and commerce in certain commodities. The Ordinance seeks to increase competition in the agriculture sector and enhance farmers’ income. It aims to liberalise the regulatory system while protecting the interests of consumers.
The Ordinance provides that the central government may regulate the supply of certain food items including cereals, pulses, potato, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils, only under extraordinary circumstances. These include: (i) war, (ii) famine, (iii) extraordinary price rise and (iv) natural calamity of grave nature.
The Ordinance requires that imposition of any stock limit on certain specified items must be based on price rise. A stock limit may be imposed only if there is: (i) 100% increase in retail price of horticultural produce; and (ii) 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable agricultural food items. The increase will be calculated over the price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or the average retail price of the last five years, whichever is lower.
The Ordinance provides that any stock limit will not apply to a processor or value chain participant of agricultural produce if stock held by such person is less than the: (i) overall ceiling of installed capacity of processing, or (ii) demand for export in case of an exporter.
The provisions of the Ordinance regarding the regulation of food items and the imposition of stock limits will not apply to any government order relating to the Public Distribution System or the Targeted Public Distribution System. Under these systems, food grains are distributed by the government to the eligible persons at subsidised prices.

ANS: B
SOL:
During the first five years of Akbar’s reign, Bairam Khan acted as his regent. He consolidated the Mughalempire. After five years he was removed by Akbar due to court intrigues and sent to Mecca. But on his way Bairam was killed by an Afghan. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
Akbar’s Rajput policy was combined with a broad religious toleration. He abolished the pilgrim tax and later the jizya. The Rajputpolicy of Akbar proved to be beneficial to the Mughal state as well as to the Rajputs. The alliance secured to the Mughals the services of the bravest warriors. On the other hand it ensured peace inRajasthan and a number of Rajputs who joined the Mughal servicerose to important positions. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
In 1582, Akbar promulgated a new religion called Din Ilahi Or Divine Faith. It believes in one God. It contained good points of all religions. Its basis was rational. It upholds no dogma. It was aimed at bridging the gulf that separated different religions. However, his new faith proved to be a failure. It fizzled out after his death. Even During his life time, it had only
fifteen followers including Birbal. Akbar did not compel anyone to his new faith.Hence Statement 3 is incorrect.

88Q Consider the following statements regarding the Minor Forest Produce (MFP):
1. It has been defined under the Forest Act, 1927.
2. Recently, Bamboo has been moved from the category of MFP to category of Trees under Indian Forest Act, 1927.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: D
SOL:
Both of the statements given above are incorrect.
Section 2(4) of the Indian Forest Act 1927 defines only "forest-produce" and this term connotes to those products whether found in, or brought from a forest such as
1. timber, charcoal, caoutchouc, catechu, wood-oil, resin, natural varnish, bark, lac, mahua flowers, mahua seeds, kuth and myrabolans,
2. trees and leaves, flowers and fruits, and all other parts or produce of trees, 3. plants not being trees (including grass, creepers, reeds and moss), and all parts or produce of such plants,
4. wild animals and skins, tusks, horns, bones, silk, cocoons, honey and wax, and all other parts or produce of animals, and
5. peat, surface soil, rock and minerals (including lime-stone, laterite, mineral oils), and all products of mines or quarries;
In short, the essential condition to be qualified as a forest produce is that the products should be either found in or be brought from forest.
Minor Forest Produce (MFP) is a subset of forest produce and got a definition only in 2007 when the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, was enacted. Section 2(i) of the said Act defines a Minor
Forest Produce (MFP) as all non-timber forest produce of plant origin and includes bamboo, brushwood, stumps, canes, Tusser, cocoon, honey, waxes, Lac, tendu/kendu leaves, medicinal plants and herbs, roots, tuber and the like.
Thus, the definition of “minor forest produce” includes bamboo and cane, thereby changing the categorization of bamboo and cane as “trees” under the Indian Forest Act 1927.
The Government of India has launched a central sector scheme for marketing of Minor Forest Produce through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of value chain to ensure fair monetary returns to MFP gatherers for their efforts in collection, primary processing, storage, packaging, transportation etc. The scheme envisages fixation and declaration of Minimum Support Price for the selected MFP based on the suggestions /inputs received from Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) which came into existence in 1987, and the States concerned.
