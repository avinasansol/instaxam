SOL:
A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500. There was an incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several Portuguese. In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab merchant ships anchored in the harbour, and killed hundreds of their crew besides confiscating their cargo and burning the ships. Calicut was bombarded by Cabral. Later, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local rulers of Cochin and Cannanore.
The first governor of the Portuguese in India was Francis de Almeida. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect. Later in 1509 Albuquerque was made the governor of the Portuguese territories in India. In 1510, he captured Goa from the ruler of Bijapur. Thereafter, Goa became the capital of the Portuguese settlements in India. Albuquerque captured Malacca and Ceylon. He also built a fort at Calicut. He encouraged his countrymen to marry Indian women. Albuquerque died in 1515 leaving the Portuguese as the strongest naval power in India. Almeida’s vision was to make the Portuguese the master of the Indian Ocean. His policy was known as the Blue Water Policy (cartaze system).

In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad. The farmans thus obtained were regarded as the Magna Carta of the Company. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
The English company’s position was improved by the ‘Golden Farman’ issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda in 1632. On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda. A member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant Francis Day in 1639 received from the ruler of Chandragiri permission to build a fortified factory at Madras which later became the Fort St. George and replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarters of the English settlements in south India.

All the above statements are correct.
Causes for the English Success and the French Failure
• The English company was a private enterprise—this created a sense of enthusiasm and self-confidence among the people. With less governmental control over it, this company could take instant decisions when needed without waiting for the approval of the government. The French company, on the other hand, was a State concern . It was controlled and regulated by the French government and was hemmed in by government policies and delays in decision making.
• The English navy was superior to the French navy; it helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French possessions in India and France.
• The English held three important places, namely, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras whereas the French had only Pondicherry.
• The French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition, which made the French company short of funds.
• In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never neglected their commercial interests. So they always had the funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help them significantly in the wars against their rivals.
• A major factor in the success of the English in India was the superiority of the commanders
in the British camp.
• In comparison to the long list of leaders on the English side—Sir Eyre Coote, Major Stringer Lawrence, Robert Clive and many others—there was only Dupleix on the French side.

(A)1 and 2 only
(B)1 and 3 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
The Regulating Act of 1773:
Provisions of the Act:
The Regulating Act reformed the Company’s Government at Home and in India. The important provisions of the Act were:
(i) The term of office of the members of the Court of Directors was extended from one year to four years. One-fourth of them were to retire every year and the retiring Directors were not eligible for re-election.
(ii) The Governor of Bengal was styled the Governor-General of Fort William whose tenure of office was for a period of five years.
(iii) A council of four members was appointed to assist the Governor-General. The government was to be conducted in accordance with the decision of the majority. The Governor- General had a casting vote in case of a tie.
(iv) The Governor-General in Council was made supreme over the other Presidencies in matters of war and peace.
(v) Provision was made in the Act for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta consisting of a Chief Justice and three junior judges. It was to be independent of the Governor General in Council. In 1774, the Supreme Court was established by a Royal Charter.
(vi) This Act prevented the servants of the Company including the Governor-General, members of his council and the judges of the Supreme Court from receiving directly or indirectly any gifts in kind or cash.
Merits and Demerits of the Act
The significance of the Regulating Act is that it brought the affairs of the Company under the control of the Parliament. Besides, it proved that the Parliament of England was concerned about the welfare of Indians. The greatest merit of this Act is that it put an end to the arbitrary rule of the Company and provided a framework for all future enactments relating to the governing of India.
The main defect of the Act was that the Governor-General was made powerless because the council which was given supreme power often created deadlocks by over ruling his decision. However, many of these defects were rectified by the Pitt’s India Act of 1784. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

Ramabai devoted her life to the improvement of women's lives. Ramabai Ranade with her husband and other colleagues established in 1886 the first girls' high school in Pune.
She established a branch of Arya Mahila Samaj in Bombay.
At the urging of Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Mr. Bhajekar, Ramabai chaired the first session of India Women Conference held in Bombay in 1904.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Pitt’s India Act, 1784:
The Regulating Act proved to be an unsatisfactory document as it failed in its objective. In January 1784, Pitt the Younger (who became Prime Minister of England after the General Elections) introduced the India Bill in the British Parliament. Despite bitter debate in both the Houses, the bill was passed after seven months and it received royal assent in August 1784. This was the famous Pitt’s India Act of 1784.
Main Provisions:
(i) A Board of Control consisting of six members was created. They were appointed by the Crown.
(ii) The Court of Directors was retained without any alteration in its composition.
(iii) The Act also introduced significant changes in the Indian administration. It reduced the number of the members of the Governor-General’s Council from four to three including the Commander-in-Chief. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Pitt’s India Act constitutes a significant landmark with regard to the foreign policy of the Company. A critical review of the Act reveals that it had introduced a kind of contradiction in the functions of the Company. The Court of Directors controlled its commercial functions, whereas the Board of Control maintained its political affairs. In fact, the Board represented the King, and the Directors symbolized the Company.

SOL:
The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act) has been amended by the Finance Act, 2016, to provide for a statutory and institutionalised framework for a Monetary Policy Committee, for maintaining price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The Monetary Policy Committee would be entrusted with the task of fixing the benchmark policy rate (repo rate) required to contain inflation within the specified target level. A Committee-based approach for determining the Monetary Policy will add lot of value and transparency to monetary policy decisions. The meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee shall be held at least 4 times a year and it shall publish its decisions after each such meeting. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
As per the provisions of the RBI Act, out of the six Members of Monetary Policy Committee, three Members will be from the RBI and the other three Members of MPC will be appointed by the Central Government.
The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the ex officio Chairperson of the committee. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

ANS: B
SOL:
Eka Movement
Towards the end of 1921, peasant discontent resurfaced in some northern districts of the
United Provinces—Hardoi, Bahraich, Sitapur. The issues involved were:
(i) high rents—50 per cent higher than the recorded rates;
(ii) oppression of thikadars in charge of revenue collection; and
(iii) practice of share-rents.
Bardoli Satyagraha:
The Bardoli taluqa in Surat district had witnessed intense politicisation after the coming of Gandhi on the national political scene. The movement sparked off in January 1926 when the authorities decided to increase the land revenue by 30 per cent.
The Congress leaders were quick to protest and a Bardoli Inquiry Committee was set up to go into the issue. The committee found the revenue hike to be unjustified. In February 1926, Vallabhbhai Patel was called to lead the movement.
Tebhaga Movement:
In September 1946, the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha gave a call to implement, through mass struggle, the Flood Commission recommendations of tebhaga—two-thirds’ share—to the bargardars, the share-croppers also known as bagchasi or adhyar, instead of the one-half share.
The bargardars worked on lands rented from the jotedars. The communist cadres, including many urban student militias went to the countryside to organise the bargardars. The central slogan was “nij khamare dhan tolo”—i.e.,
sharecroppers taking the paddy to their own threshing floor and not to the jotedar’s house, as before, so as to enforce tebhaga.

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.
Causes of Rebellion:
(i) Territorial Aggrandizement: The annexation of Oudh and Jhansi by Dalhousie employing the Doctrine of Lapse and the humiliating treatment meted out to Nana Sahib, the last Peshwa’s adopted son produced much dissatisfaction.
(ii) Oppressive Land Revenue System: The British treated land revenue as a rent and not a tax. This meant that revenue was extracted whether the land was cultivated or not, and at the same rate. The prices of agricultural commodities continued to crash throughout the first half of nineteenth century and in the absence of any remission or relief from the colonial state,
small and marginal farmers as well as cultivating tenants were subject to untold misery.
(iii) Alienation of Muslim Aristocracy and Intelligentsia: English language and western education pushed the Muslim intelligentsia into insignificance. The abolition of Persian language in the law courts and admission into public service by examination decreased the Muslim’s chances of official employment
(iv) Religious Sentiments: The Act of 1856 providing for enrolment of high caste men as sepoys in the Bengal army stipulated that future recruits give up martial careers or their caste scruples. This apart, acts such as the abolition of sati, legalization of remarriage of Hindu widows, prohibition of infanticide were viewed as interference in religious beliefs. In 1850, to the repugnance of orthodox Hindus, the Lex Loci Act was passed permitting converts to Christianity to retain their patrimony (right to inherit property from parents or ancestors) The religious sentiments of the sepoys – Hindus and Muslims – were outraged when information spread that the fat of cows and pigs was used in the greased cartridges. The Indian sepoys were to bite them before loading the new Enfield rifle. This was viewed as a measure to convert people to Christianity.

26Q The Treaty of ‘Eternal Friendship’ was signed by British with
(A)Afghanistan
(B)Sindh
(C)Bhutan
(D)Nepal
ANS: B
SOL:
Treaty of ‘Eternal Friendship’ with Sindh
In June 1807, the alliance of Tilsit with Alexander I of Russia was joined by Napoleon Bonaparte . The alliance had as one of its conditions a combined invasion of India by the land route. Now the British wanted to create a barrier between Russia and British India. To achieve this, Lord Minto sent three delegations under the leadership of various prominent persons to forge alliances. Accordingly, Metcalfe was sent to Lahore, Elphinstone to Kabul and Malcolm to Teheran. Sindh was visited by Nicholas Smith who met the Amirs to conclude a defensive arrangement. After negotiations, the Amirs agreed to a treaty—their first-ever treaty with the English. After professing eternal friendship, both sides agreed to exclude the French from Sindh and to exchange agents at each other’s court. The treaty was renewed in 1820 with the addition of an article excluding the Americans and resolving some border disputes on the side of Kachch after the final defeat of the Maratha confederacy in 1818.
Hence, option (b) is correct.
27Q Consider the following statements regarding the Lord Macaulay’s Minute
1. It recommended for the education of masses.
2. Lord Macaulay held the view that Indian learning was inferior to European learning.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
Lord Macaulay’s Minute (1835):
The famous Lord Macaulay’s Minute settled the row in favour of Anglicists—the limited government resources were to be devoted to teaching of Western sciences and literature through the medium of English language alone.
Lord Macaulay held the view that “Indian learning was inferior to European learning”—which was true as far as physical and social sciences in the contemporary stage were concerned. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
The government soon made English as the medium of instruction in its schools and colleges and opened a few English schools and colleges instead of a large number of elementary schools, thus neglecting mass education. Hence Statement 1 is incorrect.
The British planned to educate a small section of upper and middle classes, thus creating a
class “Indian in blood and colour but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect” who would act as interpreters between the government and masses and would enrich the vernaculars by which knowledge of Western sciences and literature would reach the masses. This was called the ‘downward filtration theory’.
28Q Consider the following statements regarding the Prarthana Samaj:
1. It was founded in 1867 in Bombay by Atmaram Pandurang.
2. The Prarathana Samaj continued its work mainly through educational work directed at women and workers at the lower level.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
Both the statements given above are correct.
An off-shoot of the Brahmo Samaj, the Prarthana Samaj, was founded in 1867 in Bombay by Atmaram Pandurang (1823– 98). The Prarthana Samaj as an organization never had any great influence but its members, like M. G. Ranade (1852-1901),R. G. Bhandarkar, and K.T. Telang, were among the great leaders of nineteenth century Maharashtra and they became the founders of the social reform movement in later years.
Prarthana Samaj was similar to Brahmo Samaj, but it was consciously linked with the bhakti tradition of the Maharashtrian saints. The Prarathana Samaj continued its work mainly through educational work directed at women and workers at the lower level. It concentrated on social reforms like inter-dining, intermarriage, remarriage of widows, and uplift of women and depressed classes.
29Q Consider the following statements regarding Anglo-Sikh Wars
1. The Anglo-Sikh wars gave the two sides a mutual respect for each other’s fighting prowess.
2. The first Anglo-Sikh War ended with Treaty of Amritsar.
3. John Lawrence became the first chief commissioner of Punjab.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)1 and 3 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: B
SOL:
First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46)
Causes:
The outbreak of the first of the Anglo-Sikh wars has been attributed to the action of the Sikh army crossing the River Sutlej on December 11, 1845. This was seen as an aggressive manoeuvre that provided the English with the justification to declare war.
Treaty of Lahore (March 8, 1846):
The end of the first Anglo-Sikh War forced the Sikhs to sign a humiliating treaty on March 8, 1846. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49):
Causes:
The defeat in the first Anglo-Sikh War and the provisions of the treaties of Lahore and Bhairowal were highly humiliating for the Sikhs. Inhuman treatment meted out to Rani Jindan, who was sent to Benares as a pensioner, added to the resentment of the Sikhs.
Result:
At the end of the war came:
● surrender of the Sikh army and Sher Singh in 1849;
● annexation of Punjab; and for his services the Earl of Dalhousie was given the thanks of the British Parliament and a promotion in the peerage, as Marquess;
● setting up of a three-member board to govern Punjab, comprising of the Lawrence brothers (Henry and John) and Charles Mansel.
In 1853 the board was nullified and Punjab was placed under a chief commissioner. John Lawrence became the first chief commissioner.
Significance of the Anglo-Sikh Wars
The Anglo-Sikh wars gave the two sides a mutual respect for each other’s fighting prowess. The Sikhs were to fight loyally on the British side in the Revolt of 1857 and in many other campaigns and wars until the Indian independence in 1947.
30Q Consider the following statements regarding the Teesta River:
1. It originates in the Sikkim Himalayas.
2. The Rangeet River is a main tributary of Teesta River.
3. It forms the border between Sikkim and West Bengal.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
All the statements given above are correct.
The literal meaning of the word Teesta is Trishna (desire) which never ends. The legend of the Teesta River is mentioned in Kalika Purana. Among the other rivers of northern India, Teesta River is also called as younger daughter of Himalaya.
The Teesta River originates from the Pahunri (or Teesta Kangse) glacier above 7,068 m, and flows southward through gorges and rapids in the Sikkim Himalaya. The river then flows past the town of Rangpo where the Rangpo River joins, and where it forms the border between Sikkim and West Bengal up to Teesta Bazaar. Just before the
Teesta Bridge, where the roads from Kalimpong and Darjeeling join, the river is met by its main tributary, the Rangeet River.
At this point, it changes course southwards flowing into West Bengal. The river then goes merging up with the Brahmaputra River after it bifurcates the city of Jalpaiguri and flows just touching Cooch Behar district at Mekhliganj and moves to Fulchori in Bangladesh. Teesta River ultimately drains into Brahmaputra at Teestamukh Ghat in Kamarjani- Bahadurabad in Rangpur district of Bangladesh. Teesta and most of its tributaries are flashy mountain rivers and carry boulders and considerable quantity of sediment. The flow is turbulent and characterised by high velocities.
The Teesta basin in India extends over an area of 9,855 sq.km, which is nearly 0.28% of the total geographical area of the country. The basin lies in the states of Sikkim (72.43%) and West Bengal (27.57%). Teesta is a 414 km long river with total drainage area of 12,540 sq.km, flowing through India and Bangladesh.

3. Introduction of English in the lower courts and higher courts in the place of Persian.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)1 and 3 only
(C)2 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
Bentinck reduced the salaries and allowances of all officers and additional staff were removed. In the military department, he abolished the system of double batta. (Batta was an allowance to troops on active service.) By these financial reforms at the time of his departure, he left the treasury with a surplus of Rs.1.5 millions.
Administrative Reforms:
Bentinck’s administrative reforms speak of his political maturity and wisdom. In the judicial department he abolished the provincial courts of appeal established by Cornwallis. They were largely responsible for the huge arrears of cases. This step was readily accepted by the Directors since it cut down their expenditure. Another good measure of Bentinck was the introduction of local languages in the lower courts and English in the higher courts in the place of Persian. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect. Even in matters of revenue Bentinck left his mark. He launched the revenue settlements of the North West Province under the control of R.M. Bird. This settlement was for a period of 30 years and it was made either with the tillers of the soil, or with the landowners.
32Q Consider the following statements regarding the education policies of British

(A)3 only
(B)2 only
(C)1 and 2 only
(D)None
ANS: C
SOL:
Evaluation of British Policy on Education
The British wanted to use modern education to strengthen the foundations of their political authority in India.
1. Traditional system of Indian learning gradually declined for want of support, and especially after 1844 when it was declared that applicants for government employment should possess knowledge of English.
2. Mass education was neglected leading to widespread illiteracy (1911—84 per cent and in 1921—92 per cent) which created a wide linguistic and cultural gulf between the educated few and the masses. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
3. Since education was to be paid for, it became a monopoly of upper and richer classes and city dwellers. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
4. There was an almost total neglect of women’s education because (i) the Government did not want to arouse wrath of orthodox sections; and (ii) it had no immediate utility for the colonial rule.
5. Scientific and technical education was by and large neglected. By 1857 there were only three medical colleges at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, and only one good engineering college at Roorkee which was open only to Europeans and Eurasians. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

(B)Lord Auckland
(C)Lord Lytton
(D)John Lawrence
ANS: D
SOL:
John Lawrence and the Policy of Masterly Inactivity:

John Lawrence (1864-1869) started a policy of masterly inactivity which was a reaction to the disasters of the First Afghan War and an outcome of practical common sense and an intimate knowledge of the frontier problem and of Afghan passion for independence. Even when Dost
Mohammed died in 1863, there was no interference in the war of succession. Lawrence’s policy rested on the fulfillment of two conditions—(i) that the peace at the frontier was not disturbed, and (ii) that no candidate in civil war sought foreign help. And as Sher Ali established himself on the throne, Lawrence tried to cultivate friendship with him.
Hence, option (d) is correct.

ANS: D
SOL:
None of the statements given above are correct.
The Indian Councils Act of 1861is an important landmark in the constitutional and political history of India.
Features of the Act of 1861:
1. It made a beginning of representative institutions by associating Indians with the law-making process. It thus provided that the viceroy should nominate some Indians as non-official members of his expanded council. In 1862, Lord Canning, the then viceroy, nominated three Indians to his legislative council—the Raja of Benaras, the
Maharaja of Patiala and Sir Dinkar Rao.
2. It initiated the process of decentralisation by restoring the legislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. It thus reversed the centralising tendency that started from the Regulating Act of 1773 andreached its climax under the Charter Act of 1833. This policy of legislative devolution resulted in the grant of almost complete internal autonomy to the provinces in 1937.
3. It also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, North-Western Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab, which were established in 1862, 1866 and 1897 respectively.
4. It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the more convenient transaction of business in the council. It also gave a recognition to the ‘portfolio’ system, introduced by Lord Canning in1859. Under this, a member of the Viceroy’s council was made in-charge of one or
more departments of the government and was authorised to issue final orders on behalf of the council on matters of his department(s).

The maximum permissible age was gradually reduced from 23 (in 1859) to 22 (in 1860) to 21 (in 1866) and to 19 (1878). In 1863, Satyendra Nath Tagore became the first Indian to qualify for the Indian Civil Service.
Statutory Civil Service:
In 1878-79, Lytton introduced the Statutory Civil Service consisting of one-sixth of covenanted posts to be filled by Indians of high families through nominations by local governments subject to approval by the secretary of State and the viceroy. But the system failed and was abolished.
Government of India Act, 1935:
The 1935 Act recommended the establishment of a Federal Public Service Commission and Provincial Public Service Commission under their spheres. But the positions of control and authority remained in British hands and the process of Indianisation of the civil service did not put effective political power in Indian hands since the Indian bureaucrats acted as the agents of colonial rule.

The First Carnatic War was an extension of the Anglo-French War in Europe which was caused by the Austrian War of Succession. Hence statement 2 is correct.
Immediate Cause Although France, conscious of its relatively weaker position in India, did not favour an extension of hostilities to India, the English navy under Barnet seized some French ships to provoke France. France retaliated by seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais, the French governor of Mauritius. Thus began the first Carnatic War.
Result: The First Carnatic War ended in 1748 when the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle was signed bringing the Austrian War of Succession to a conclusion.
Under the terms of this treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the French, in turn, got their territories in North America.

Preservation of Archaeological objects
Curzon had a passion for preserving the ancient monuments of historical importance in India. No Viceroy in India before or after him took such a keen interest in archaeological objects. He passed a law called the Ancient Monuments Act, 1904 which made it obligatory on the part of the government and local authorities to preserve the monuments of archaeological importance and their destruction an offence.

The Ilbert Bill controversy
The Ilbert Bill was presented in the Central Legislature during the Viceroyalty of Lord Ripon. The Bill tried to remove racial inequality between Indian and European judges in courts. This Bill was opposed by the British residents in India. Ultimately the Bill was modified.
Ripon’s Government had sought to abolish “judicial disqualification based on race distinctions” and to give the Indian members of the covenanted civil service the same powers and rights as
those enjoyed by their European colleagues. Ripon had to modify the bill, thus almost defeating the original purpose, because of the stiff opposition from the European community. It became clear to the nationalists that justice and fair play could not be expected where interests of the European community were involved. However, the organised agitation by the Europeans to revoke the Ilbert Bill also taught the nationalists how to agitate for certain rights and demands.

66Q The word swaraj was mentioned for the first time in which of the following congress session?

(B)Congress session held at Banaras (1905)
(C)Congress session held at Calcutta (1906)
(D)Congress session held at Surat (1907)
ANS: C
SOL:
The Indian National Congress, meeting in 1905 under the presidentship of Gokhale, resolved to (i) condemn the partition of Bengal and the reactionary policies of Curzon, and (ii) support the anti-partition and Swadeshi Movement of Bengal.
The militant nationalists led by Tilak, Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh wanted the movement to be taken outside Bengal to other parts of the country and go beyond a boycott of foreign goods to become a fullfledged political mass struggle with the goal of attaining swaraj. But the Moderates, dominating the Congress at that time, were not willing to go that far.
However, a big step forward was taken at the Congress session held at Calcutta (1906) under the presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji, where it was declared that the goal of the Indian National Congress was “self-government or swaraj like the United Kingdom or the colonies” of Australia or Canada.
Hence, option (c) is correct.
The word swaraj was mentioned for the first time, but its connotation was not spelt out, which left the field open for differing interpretations by the Moderates and the Extremists.
The Moderate-Extremist dispute over the pace of the movement and techniques of struggle reached a deadlock at the Surat session of the Indian National Congress (1907) where the party split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.

Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy. However, the federation never came into being as the princely states did not join it.
2. It abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres. Moreover, the Act introduced responsible governments in provinces, that is, the governor was
required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in 1937 and was discontinued in 1939.
3. It provided for the adoption of dyarchy at the Centre. Consequently, the federal subjects were divided into reserved subjects and transferred subjects. However, this provision of the Act did not come into operation at all.
4. It introduced bicameralism in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of Bengal, Bombay, Madras, Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces were made bicameral consisting of a legislative council (upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house). However, many restrictions were placed on them.
5. It further extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates for depressed classes (scheduled castes), women and labour (workers).

It hoped to raise funds for its activities through dacoities. It was suppressed prematurely.
Hence, statement 1 is correct.
During the 1890s, Tilak propagated a spirit of militant nationalism, including use of violence, through Ganapati and Shivaji festivals and his journals Kesari and Maharatta. Two of his

78Q Consider the following statements regarding the Communal Award
1. The Communal Award was based on the findings of the Indian Franchise Committee.
2. The Simon Commission accepted the proposal of separate electorate for the depressed classes.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
The Communal Award was announced by the British prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, on August 16, 1932. The Communal Award, based on the findings of the Indian Franchise Committee (also called the Lothian Committee), established separate electorates and reserved seats for minorities, including the depressed classes which were granted seventy eight reserved seats. Hence Statement 1 is correct.
Thus, this award accorded separate electorates for Muslims, Europeans, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, depressed classes, and even to the Marathas for some seats in Bombay. The award was perceived by the national leaders led by the Congress as another manifestation of the British policy of divide and rule.
It should be noted here that Dr B.R. Ambedkar in the past, in his testimony to the Simon Commission, had stressed that the depressed classes should be treated as a distinct, independent minority separate from the caste Hindus. Even, the Bengal Depressed Classes Association had lobbied for separate electorates with seats reserved according to the proportion of depressed class members to the total population as well as for adult franchise. But the Simon Commission rejected the proposal of separate electorate for the depressed classes; however, it retained the concept of reserving seats. Hence Statement 2 is incorrect.

(A)Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh
(B)Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur
(C)Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram
(D)Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and Tripura
ANS: C
SOL:
The Sixth Schedule currently includes 10 autonomous district councils in four northeastern States — Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura.
Hence, option (c) is correct.
Passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1949, it seeks to safeguard the rights of tribal population through the formation of Autonomous District Councils (ADC).
This special provision is provided under Article 244(2) and Article 275(1) of the Constitution. Key provisions:
The governor is empowered to organise and re-organise the autonomous districts.
If there are different tribes in an autonomous district, the governor can divide the district into several autonomous regions.
Composition: Each autonomous district has a district council consisting of 30 members, of whom four are nominated by the governor and the remaining 26 are elected on the basis of adult franchise.

Term: The elected members hold office for a term of five years (unless the council is dissolved earlier) and nominated members hold office during the pleasure of the governor.
Each autonomous region also has a separate regional council.
Powers of councils: The district and regional councils administer the areas under their jurisdiction. They can make laws on certain specified matters like land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation, village administration, inheritance of property, marriage and divorce, social customs and so on. But all such laws require the assent of the governor. Village councils: The district and regional councils within their territorial jurisdictions can constitute village councils or courts for trial of suits and cases between the tribes. They hear appeals from them. The jurisdiction of high court over these suits and cases is specified by the governor.
Powers and functions: The district council can establish, construct or manage primary schools, dispensaries, markets, ferries, fisheries, roads and so on in the district. It can also make regulations for the control of money lending and trading by non-tribals. But, such regulations require the assent of the governor. The district and regional councils are empowered to assess and collect land revenue and to impose certain specified taxes.
Exceptions: The acts of Parliament or the state legislature do not apply to autonomous districts and autonomous regions or apply with specified modifications and exceptions.
The governor can appoint a commission to examine and report on any matter relating to the administration of the autonomous districts or regions. He may dissolve a district or regional council on the recommendation of the commission.

81Q Consider the following statements regarding nationalist response to British participation in the First World War
1. Both the Moderates and Extremists supported the British in the war as a matter of duty.
2. Revolutionaries decided to utilize the opportunity to wage a war on British rule.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
In the First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with France, Russia, USA, Italy and Japan against Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. This period saw the maturing of Indian nationalism. The nationalist response to British participation in the First World War was three fold:
(i) the Moderates supported the empire in the war as a matter of duty;
(ii) the Extremists, including Tilak (who was released in June 1914), supported the war efforts in the mistaken belief that Britain would repay India’s loyalty with gratitude in the form of self-government; Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
(iii) the revolutionaries decided to utilize the opportunity to wage a war on British rule and liberate the country.
Hence, statement 2 is correct.
The Indian supporters of British war efforts failed to see that the imperialist powers were fighting to safeguard their own colonies and markets.
82Q Consider the following statements
1. Gandhi held that the centre of religion must be between man and man, and not between man and God alone, as preached by Ambedkar.
2. Gandhi held that caste system in Hinduism has nothing to do with religious precepts and spirituality
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
Gandhi, the principal architect of the Indian freedom struggle,
and B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Constitution
of independent India shared many ideas, though in many ways
they held different beliefs.
The caste system and untouchability were the manifestations of the Hindu religious scriptures. On the contrary, Gandhi held that caste system in Hinduism has nothing to do with Nvneet Prasad
religious precepts and spirituality. Hence Statement 2 is correct.
Ambedkar held that the centre of religion must be between man and man, and not between man and God alone, as preached by Gandhi. In the beginning, Ambedkar too wanted to cast away the evil practices prevalent in Hinduism in an attempt to reform and reconstruct, rather than destroy it fully. But in the later phase of his life, he left Hinduism, denouncing it as an entity which couldn’t be reformed. Hence Statement 1 is incorrect.
Ambedkar denounced the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures. He believed that the Hindu scriptures do not lend themselves to a unified and coherent understanding, and reflect strong contradictions within and across sects. And the caste system and untouchability were the manifestations of the Hindu religious scriptures. On the contrary, Gandhi held that caste system in Hinduism has nothing to do with religious precepts and spirituality. For Gandhi, caste and varna are different, and caste is perversive degeneration.
83Q Consider the following pairs of Indian women social reformers and their work:

Social Reformer - Works:

3. Rashsundari Devi - The Golden Threshold

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(A)1 and 3 only
(B)2 only
(C)1, 2 and 3
(D)None
ANS: B
SOL:
Sarojini Naidu was an Indian political activist and poet. Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet 'Nightingale of India' by Mahatma Gandhi. "The Golden Threshold" was one of the book written by her.
Hence, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.
Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain learnt to read and write Bangla and English with the support of her elder brother and an elder sister. She went on to become a writer. She wrote a remarkable story titled Sultana’s Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25 years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study, work, and create inventions like controlling rain from the clouds and flying air cars.
Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched.
Rassundari Devi is among the earliest woman writers in Bengali literature. Her autobiography Amar Jiban (My Life) is known as the first published autobiography in Bengali language.
Hence, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.
84Q Consider the following statements regarding Home Rule League Movement

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
Home Rule League Movement
The Home Rule Movement was the Indian response to the First World War in a less charged but a more effective way than the response of Indians living abroad which took the form of the romantic Ghadr adventure.
Prominent leaders—Balgangadhar Tilak, Annie Besant, G.S. Khaparde, Sir S. Subramania Iyer, Joseph Baptista and Mohammad Ali Jinnah among others—got together and decided that it was necessary to have a national alliance that would work throughout the year (unlike the Congress which had annual sessions) with the main objective of demanding self-government or home rule for all of India within the British commonwealth. This alliance was to be the All India Home Rule League along the lines of the Irish Home Rule League. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
In the end, however, two Home Rule Leagues were launched—one by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the other by Annie Besant, both with the aim of beginning a new trend of aggressive politics.
Both Tilak and Besant realized that the sanction of a Moderate-dominated Congress as well as full cooperation of the Extremists was essential for the movement to succeed. Having failed at the 1914 session of the Congress to reach a Moderate-Extremist rapprochement, Tilak and Besant decided to revive political activity on their own.
In 1920, Gandhi accepted the presidentship of the All India Home Rule League, and
changed the organisation’s name to Swarajya Sabha. Within a year, however, the league joined the Indian National Congress.
Hence, statement 2 is correct.

86Q Consider the following statements regarding Individual Satyagraha
1. Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer the satyagraha
2. The demand of the satyagrahi would be the freedom of speech against the war through an anti-war declaration.

Which of the statements given above is/are not correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: D
SOL:
Both the statements are correct.
The aims of launching individual satyagraha were — (i) to show that nationalist patience was not due to weakness;
(ii) to express people’s feeling that they were not interested in the war and that they made no distinction between Nazism and the double autocracy that ruled India; and
(iii) to give another opportunity to the government to accept Congress’
demands peacefully.
The demand of the satyagrahi would be the freedom of speech against the war through an anti-war declaration.
If the government did not arrest the satyagrahi, he or she would not only repeat it but move into villages and start a march towards Delhi, thus precipitating a movement which came to be known as the ‘Delhi Chalo Movement’.
Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer the satyagraha and Nehru, the second. By May 1941, 25,000 people had been convicted for individual civil disobedience.

(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
The Rowlatt Act
Just six months before the Montford Reforms were to be put into effect, two bills were introduced in the Imperial Legislative Council. One of them was dropped, but the other—an extension to the Defence of India Regulations Act 1915—was passed in March 1919. It was what was officially called the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, but popularly known
as the Rowlatt Act. It was based on the recommendations made in the previous year to the Imperial Legislative Council by the Rowlatt Commission, headed by the British judge, Sir Sidney Rowlatt, to investigate the ‘seditious conspiracy’ of the Indian people. (The committee had recommended that activists should be deported or imprisoned without trial for two years, and that even possession of seditious newspapers would be adequate evidence of guilt.) Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The act allowed political activists to be tried without juries or even imprisoned without trial. It allowed arrest of Indians without warrant on the mere suspicion of ‘treason’. Such suspects could be tried in secrecy without recourse to legal help. A special cell consisting of three high court judges was to try such suspects and there was no court of appeal above that panel. This panel could even accept evidence not acceptable under the Indian Evidences Act. The law of habeas corpus, the basis of civil liberty, was sought to be suspended.
Hence, statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
The Khilafat issue paved the way for the consolidation of the emergence of a radical nationalist trend among the younger generation of Muslims and the section of traditional Muslim scholars who were becoming increasingly critical of British rule.
In India, too, the Muslims demanded from the British
(i) that the Khalifa’s control over Muslim sacred places should be retained, and (ii) the Khalifa should be left with sufficient territories after territorial arrangements.
In early 1919, a Khilafat Committee was formed under the leadership of the Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali), Maulana Azad, Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani, to force the British government to change its attitude towards Turkey. Thus, the ground for a country-wide agitation was prepared.
Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The All India Khilafat Conference held in Delhi in November 1919, a call was made for the boycott of British goods. The Khilafat leaders also clearly spelt out that unless peace terms after the War were favourable to Turkey they would stop all cooperation with the Government. Gandhi, who was the president of the All India Khilafat Committee, saw in the issue a platform from which mass and united noncooperation could be declared against the Government. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.

Genesis of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party
After Gandhi’s arrest (March 1922), there was disintegration, disorganisation and demoralisation among nationalist ranks. A debate started among Congressmen on what to do during the transition period, i.e., the passive phase of the movement. One section led by C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru and Ajmal Khan wanted an end to the boycott of legislative councils so that the nationalists could enter them to expose the basic weaknesses of these assemblies and use these councils as an arena of political struggle to arouse popular enthusiasm. They wanted, in other words, to ‘end or mend’ these councils, i.e., if the government did not respond to the nationalists’ demands, then they would obstruct the working of these councils.
Those advocating entry into legislative councils came to be known as the ‘Swarajists’, while the other school of thought led by C. Rajagopalachari, Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad and M.A. Ansari came to be known as the ‘Nochangers’.
The ‘No-changers’ opposed council entry, advocated concentration on constructive work, and continuation of boycott and non-cooperation, and quiet preparation for resumption of the suspended civil disobedience programme. The differences over the question of council entry between the two schools of thought resulted in the defeat of the Swarajists’ proposal of ‘ending or mending’ the councils at the Gaya session of the Congress (December1922). C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru resigned from the presidentship and secretaryship respectively of the Congress and announced the formation of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party or simply Swarajist Party, with C.R. Das as the president and Motilal Nehru as one of the secretaries.

Hence, option (b) is correct
