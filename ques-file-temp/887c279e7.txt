1Q The total market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a set time period is
(A)Gross National Income (GNI)
(B)Gross national product (GNP)
(C)Gross Domestic product (GDP)
(D)Gross Value Added (GVA)
ANS: C
SOL:
Gross National Income (GNI)

GNI is the total amount of money earned by a nation's people and businesses. It is used to measure and track a nation's wealth from year to year. The number includes the nation's gross domestic product plus the income it receives from overseas sources.
GNI is an alternative to gross domestic product (GDP) as a means of measuring and tracking a nation's wealth and is considered a more accurate indicator for some nations.
Understanding GNI
GNI calculates the total income earned by a nation's people and businesses, including investment income, regardless of where it was earned. It also covers money received from abroad such as foreign investment and economic development aid.
GDP is the total market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a set time period. Hence, option (c) is correct.
GNI is the total income received by the country from its residents and businesses regardless of whether they are located in the country or abroad.
GNP includes the income of all of a country's residents and businesses whether it flows back to the country or is spent abroad. It also adds subsidies and taxes from foreign sources.
Converting GDP to GNI
To convert a nation’s GDP to GNI, three terms need to be added to the former: 1) Foreign income paid to resident employees,
2) Foreign income paid to residential property owners and investors, and
3) net taxes minus subsidies receivable on production and imports.
2Q Consider the following statements regarding John Maynard Keynes
1. He, for the first time, advised the state economies to adopt ‘market socialism’.
2. He coined the term Market Socialism.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: D
SOL:
Mixed Economy
The belief in the self-correcting quality of the market and the ‘invisible hand’ of Adam Smith got a major setback in early 20th century during the Great Depression (1929). The impact of the depression spread from the USA to other economies of Western Europe escalating large scale unemployment, downfall in demand and economic activities and lockouts in industrial enterprises. The prevailing Smithonian macro ideas failed to check the crisis. A new approach was needed which came in the famous work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936) by the English economist at Cambridge University, John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946).
Keynes questioned the very principles of ‘laissez-faire’ and the nature of the ‘invisible hand’. He even opined that the invisible hand brings equilibirium to the economy but by ‘strangulating the poor’. He suggested that prices and wages are not flexible enough to provide employment to all. It means there will be some people unemployed when the economy will be at its full potential. Ultimately, a fall in demand will be imminent resulting in recession and if unchecked, in depression which happened in 1929. Questioning the limitations of the market mechanism, Keynes suggested strong government intervention in the economy. To get the economy out of the depression, he suggested an increase in government expenditures, discretionary fiscal policy (fiscal deficit, lower interest rates, cheap money supply, etc.) to boost the demand of goods and services as this was the reason behind the depression. As Keynesian policies were followed, the concerned economies were successfully pulled out of the Great Depression.
On the margins of these developments, it is interesting to note the developments that occurred in the state economies of the time. It was Oscar Lange (1904–65), the Polish philosopher, who in 1950s suggested the same things for the socialist economy as Keynes had suggested for the capitalist economy. Lange praised the state economy for many of its good things, but also suggested inclusion of some of the good things of the capitalistic economy. He advised the state economies to adopt ‘market socialism’ (the term was coined by him). Hence, both statement 1 and 2 are incorrect.
His suggestions were outrightly rejected by the state economies as such compromises in the socialistic economic order were blasphemous at that time (this was taken as a suggestion towards democracy from dictatorship).
3Q Which of the following was/were the policy reforms under Washington Consensus?
1. Interest rate liberalisation
2. Liberalisation of FDI inflows
3. Fiscal discipline
4. Secure property rights

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(A)1, 2 and 3 only
(B)2, 3 and 4 only
(C)1, 2 and 4 only
(D)1, 2, 3 and 4
ANS: D
SOL:
Washington consensus
The term ‘Washington Consensus’ was coined by the US economist John Williamson (in 1989) under which he had suggested a set of policy reforms which most of the official in Washington (i.e., International Monetary Fund and World Bank) thought would be good for the crisis driven Latin American countries of the time. The policy reforms included ten propositions:
(i) Fiscal discipline
(ii) A redirection of public expenditure priorities toward fields offering both high economic returns and the potential to improve income distribution, such as primary health care, primary education, and infrastructure.
(iii) Tax reform (to lower marginal rates and broaden the tax base)
(iv) Interest rate liberalisation
(v) A competitive exchange rate
(vi) Trade liberalisation
(vii) Liberalisation of FDI inflows
(viii) Privatisation
(ix) Deregulation (in the sense of abolishing barriers to entry and exit)
(x) Secure property rights
All the above are correct.
However, in coming times, the term became synonymous to neo-liberalism (in Latin America), market fundamentalism (as George Soros told in 1998) and even globalization across the world. It has often been used to describe an extreme and dogmatic commitment to the belief that markets can handle everything.
4Q Consider the following statements regarding consumer durables
1. Goods like food and clothing, and services like recreation that are consumed when purchased by their ultimate consumers are called consumer durables.
2. They undergo wear and tear with gradual use and often need to be preserved, maintained and renewed.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: B
SOL:
Of the final goods, we can distinguish between consumption goods and capital goods. Goods like food and clothing, and services like recreation that are consumed when purchased by their ultimate consumers are called consumption goods or consumer goods. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
(This also includes services which are consumed but for convenience we may refer to them as consumer goods.) Then there are other goods that are of durable character which are used in the production process. These are tools, implements and machines.
While they make production of other commodities feasible, they themselves don’t get transformed in the production process. They are also final goods yet they are not final goods to be ultimately consumed. Unlike the final goods that we have considered above, they are the crucial backbone of any production process, in aiding and enabling the production to take place. These goods form a part of capital, one of the crucial factors of production in which a productive enterprise has invested, and they continue to enable the production process to go on for continuous cycles of production. These are capital goods and they gradually undergo wear and tear, and thus are repaired or gradually replaced over time. The stock of capital that an economy possesses is thus preserved, maintained and renewed partially or wholly over time and this is of some importance in the discussion that will follow.
We may note here that some commodities like television sets, automobiles or home computers, although they are for ultimate consumption, have one characteristic in common with capital goods – they are also durable. That is, they are not extinguished by immediate or even short period consumption; they have a relatively long life as compared to articles such as food or even clothing. They also undergo wear and tear with gradual use and often need repairs and replacements of parts, i.e., like machines they also need to be preserved, maintained and renewed. That is why we call these goods consumer durables.
Of the total production taking place in the economy a large number of products don’t end up in final consumption and are not capital goods either. Such goods may be used by other producers as material inputs. Examples are steel sheets used for making automobiles and
copper used for making utensils.
These are intermediate goods, mostly used as raw material or inputs for production of other commodities. These are not final goods.
5Q Which of the following are benefits/potential benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)?
1. It will result into higher economic growth as GDP is expected to rise by about 2%.
2. It has expanded the tax base and introduced higher transparency in the taxation system.
3. It has facilitated the freedom of movement of goods and services and created a common market in the country.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
Goods and Service Tax (GST) is the single comprehensive indirect tax, operational from 1 July 2017, on supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer/ service provider to the consumer. It is a destination-based consumption tax with facility of Input Tax Credit in the supply chain. It is applicable throughout the country with one rate for one type of goods/service. It has amalgamated a large number of Central and State taxes and cesses. It has replaced large number of taxes on goods and services levied on production/sale of goods or provision of service.
GST has simplified the multiplicity of taxes on goods and services.

The laws, procedures and rates of taxes across the country are standardized. It has facilitated the freedom of movement of goods and services and created a common market in the country.
It is aimed at reducing the cost of business operations and cascading effect of various taxes on consumers. It has also reduced the overall cost of production, which will make Indian products/services more competitive in the domestic and international markets.
It will also result into higher economic growth as GDP is expected to rise by about 2%.

Compliance will also be easier as all tax payment related services like registration, returns, payments are available online through a common portal www.gst.gov.in.
It has expanded the tax base, introduced higher transparency in the taxation system, reduced human interface between Taxpayer and Government and is furthering ease of doing business.
All the above statements are correct.
6Q Consider the following statements regarding Northeast monsoon
1. Tamil Nadu records about 48 per cent of its annual rainfall during north east monsoon.
2. La Niña conditions enhance the rainfall associated with the Northeast monsoon.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Why has the Northeast monsoon remained subdued this year?
Context:
Rainfall over the Southern peninsular region has been deficient so far.

The reason is:
1. Prevalent La Niña condition, along with a low-pressure belt that is currently lying to the north of its normal position.
2. The current position of the Inter Tropical Convective Zone (ITCZ).
What is La Nina?
La Niña (Spanish for ‘little girl’) is an abnormal cooling of eastern and central regions of the Pacific Ocean surface waters.

Together, the El Niño and La Niña phenomena are termed as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
These are large-scale ocean phenomena which inflence the global weather — winds, temperature and rainfall.
They have the ability to trigger extreme weather events like droughts, floods, hot and cold conditions, globally.
Each cycle can last anywhere between 9 to 12 months, at times extendable to 18 months — and re-occur after every three to five years.
What is the Northeast monsoon?
Occurs during October to December, and is a small-scale monsoon compared to South West Monsoon.
It is confined to the Southern peninsula.
Tamil Nadu records about 48 per cent (447.4 mm) of its annual rainfall (943.7 mm) during these months, making it the key factor for undertaking agricultural activities and reservoir management in the state.
The rainfall associated with the Northeast monsoon is important for Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Yanam, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, north interior Karnataka, Mahe and Lakshadweep.






Some South Asian countries such as Maldives, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, too, record rainfall during October to December.
But how is La Niña linked with the Northeast monsoon?
While La Niña conditions enhance the rainfall associated with the Southwest monsoon, it has a negative impact on rainfall associated with the Northeast monsoon. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
During La Niña years, the synoptic systems — low pressure or cyclones — formed in the Bay of Bengal remain significantly to the north of their normal position.
Besides, instead of moving westwards, these systems recurve. As they lie to the north of
their normal position, not much rainfall occurs over southern regions like Tamil Nadu.

7Q Consider the following statements regarding South Asian University (SAU)
1. It is an international university established by the seven member nations of South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) except Pakistan.
2. SAU started its operations from the academic year 2019.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: D
SOL:
South Asian University (SAU) is an international university established by the eight member nations of South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) viz. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
SAU started its operations from the academic year 2010. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
The university now offers post-graduate and doctoral programmes in various disciplines that include Economics, Computer Science, Biotechnology, Mathematics,






Sociology, International Relations and Law. It will ultimately have 11 post-graduate faculties and a faculty of undergraduate studies. SAU attracts students from all member nations and its degrees are recognised by all the eight SAARC countries.
The University is currently functioning from Akbar Bhawan Campus in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi before it eventually moves in to its 100 acre campus in Maidan Garhi, South Delhi where construction is under way.

8Q Consider the following statements regarding cyclones
1. The practice of naming tropical cyclones is said to be initiated by meteorologist Clement Wragge.
2. In 2000, a group of nations called WMO/ESCAP (World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) decided to start naming cyclones in the region.
3. The maximum permissible length of the cyclone names is eight letters.

(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
History of naming cyclones
The history of naming hurricanes dates back to the early 19th century with people naming storms after the places they hit, names of the saints on whose day the hurricane occurred, or simply the year of their occurrence. The practice of naming tropical cyclones is said to be initiated by well-known meteorologist Clement Wragge during the late 19th century. In the beginning, storms were named arbitrarily. For instance, a storm over the Atlantic in 1842 was known as Antje's hurricane because it ripped off the mast of a boat named Antje.
During the mid 20th century, western meteorologists started naming cyclones using some common women names for ease of identifying when there are multiple systems over a particular ocean basin. Fortunately, this seemingly gender-biased system came to an end by






2000 after several protests. In 1997, Hong Kong proposed using local names for regional cyclones rather than using the European and American names.
In 2000, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) agreed to start assigning names for cyclones over the North Indian Ocean using a list of names suggested by the countries surrounding the ocean basin. Initially, India expressed reservations to naming cyclones and after four years of continuous deliberations, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) named the first tropical cyclone as Onil in September 2004.
Process of naming
There are six regional specialised meteorological centres (RSMCs) and five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs) across the globe to monitor cyclogenesis, issue advisories and name cyclones. IMD's RSMC in New Delhi is one among them that provide advisories to
13 countries in the north Indian Ocean basin: Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. RSMC, New Delhi is also responsible for naming cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
As per the WMO guidelines, a list of 64 names was drawn in 2004 using the suggested names from eight countries in the region. Cyclone Amphan was the last cyclone to get its name from the old list. Out of several criteria for naming cyclones, some very important ones are: names should be politically and culturally neutral, should not be rude and cruel and should be short, easy to pronounce. The maximum permissible length of the cyclone names is eight
letters.
https://weather.com/en-IN/india/news/news/2020-11-25-why-nivar-heres-the-history-and-proces s-of-naming-the-devastating
In 2000, a group of nations called WMO/ESCAP (World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific), which comprised Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand, decided to start naming cyclones in the region. After each country sent in suggestions, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones (PTC) finalised the list.
The WMO/ESCAP expanded to include five more countries in 2018 — Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
The list of 169 cyclone names released by IMD last month, in April, were provided by these countries — 13 suggestions from each of the 13 countries.

9Q Consider the following statements
1. Production taxes and subsidies are paid or received in relation to production and are independent of the volume of production.
2. Product taxes and subsidies are paid or received per unit or product.
3. Factor cost includes only the payment to factors of production including tax.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
In India, the most highlighted measure of national income has been the GDP at factor cost. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) of the Government of India has been reporting the GDP at factor cost and at market prices. In its revision in January 2015 the CSO replaced GDP at factor cost with the GVA at basic prices, and the GDP at market prices, which is now called only GDP, is now the most highlighted measure.
Here we discuss the concept of basic prices. The distinction between factor cost, basic prices and market prices is based on the distinction between net production taxes (production taxes less production subsidies) and net product taxes (product taxes less product subsidies). Production taxes and subsidies are paid or received in relation to production and are independent of the volume of production such as land revenues, stamp and registration fee. Product taxes and subsidies, on the other hand, are paid or received per unit or product, e.g., excise tax, service tax, export and import duties etc. Factor cost includes only the payment to factors of production, it does not include any tax. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
In order to arrive at the market prices, we have to add to the factor cost the total indirect taxes less total subsidies. The basic prices lie in between: they include the production taxes (less production subsidies) but not product taxes (less product subsidies). Therefore, in order to arrive at market prices we have to add product taxes (less product subsidies) to the basic prices.
As stated above, now the CSO releases GVA at basic prices. Thus, it includes the net production taxes but not net product taxes. In order to arrive at the GDP (at market prices) we need to add net product taxes to GVA at basic prices.
Thus,
GVA at factor costs + Net production taxes = GVA at basic prices
GVA at basic prices + Net product taxes = GVA at market prices
10Q Which of the following is/are the components used to derive Personal Income (PI)?
1. National Income (NI)
2. Undistributed profits
3. Net interest payments made by households
4. Corporate tax
5. Transfer payments

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(A)1, 2 and 4 only
(B)2, 3 and 4 only
(C)2, 3 and 5 only
(D)1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
ANS: D
SOL:
NNP at factor cost º National Income (NI) = NNP at market prices – (Indirect taxes – Subsidies) = NNP at market prices – Net indirect taxes (Net indirect taxes º Indirect taxes – Subsidies)
We can further subdivide the National Income into smaller categories. Let us try to find the expression for the part of NI which is received by households. We shall call this Personal Income (PI). First, let us note that out of NI, which is earned by the firms and government enterprises, a part of profit is not distributed among the factors of production. This is called Undistributed Profits (UP).
Personal Income (PI) = NI – Undistributed profits – Net interest payments made by households – Corporate tax + Transfer payments to the households from the government and firms.
All the above are correct.
However, even PI is not the income over which the households have complete say. They have to pay taxes from PI. If we deduct the Personal Tax Payments (income tax, for example) and Non-tax Payments (such as fines) from PI, we obtain what is known as the Personal Disposable Income. Thus Personal Disposable Income (PDI) = PI – Personal tax payments – Non-tax payments.
Personal Disposable Income is the part of the aggregate income which belongs to the households. They may decide to consume a part of it, and save the rest.
11Q Consider the following statements regarding Currency Note
1. Fiat money do not have intrinsic value like a gold or silver coin.
2. Legal tenders can be refused by anyone as a mode of payment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Every currency note bears on its face a promise from the Governor of RBI that if someone produces the note to RBI, or any other commercial bank, RBI will be responsible for giving the person purchasing power equal to the value printed on the note. The same is also true of coins.
Currency notes and coins are therefore called fiat money. They do not have intrinsic value like a gold or silver coin. They are also called legal tenders as they cannot be refused by any citizen of the country for settlement of any kind of transaction. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Cheques drawn on savings or current accounts, however, can be refused by anyone as a mode of payment. Hence, demand deposits are not legal tenders.
12Q Consider the following statements regarding Money supply
1. The total stock of money in circulation among the public at a particular point of time is called money supply.
2. M1 and M2 are known as broad money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Money supply, like money demand, is a stock variable. The total stock of money in circulation among the public at a particular point of time is called money supply. RBI publishes figures for four alternative measures of money supply, viz. M1, M2, M3 and M4. They are defined as follows
M1 = CU + DD
M2 = M1 + Savings deposits with Post Office savings banks
M3 = M1 + Net time deposits of commercial banks
M4 = M3 + Total deposits with Post Office savings organizations (excluding National Savings Certificates)
where, CU is currency (notes plus coins) held by the public and DD is net demand deposits held by commercial banks. The word ‘net’ implies that only deposits of the public held by the banks are to be included in money supply. The interbank deposits, which a commercial bank holds in other commercial banks, are not to be regarded as part of money supply.
M1 and M2 are known as narrow money. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
M3 and M4 are known as broad money. These measures are in decreasing order of liquidity. M1 is most liquid and easiest for transactions whereas M4 is least liquid of all. M3 is the most
commonly used measure of money supply. It is also known as aggregate monetary resources.
13Q Which of the following is/are the benefits/potential benefits of Demonetization?
1. It could help tax administration by shifting transactions out of the cash economy into the formal payment system.
2. It improved tax compliance as a large number of people were bought in the tax ambit.
3. The savings of an individual were channelised into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Demonetization was a new initiative taken by the Government of India in November 2016 to tackle the problem of corruption, black money, terrorism and circulation of fake currency in the economy. Old currency notes of Rs 500, and Rs 1000 were no longer legal tender. New currency notes in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 2000 were launched.
This move received both appreciation and criticism. There were long queues outside banks and ATM booths. The shortage of currency in circulation had an adverse impact on the economic activities. However, things improved with time and normalcy returned.
This move has had positive impact also.






It improved tax compliance as a large number of people were bought in the tax ambit.
The savings of an individual were channelised into the formal financial system. As a result, banks have more resources at their disposal which can be used to provide more loans at lower interest rates.
It is a demonstration of State’s decision to put a curb on black money, showing that tax evasion will no longer be tolerated. Tax evasion will result in financial penalty and social condemnation. Tax compliance will improve and corruption will decrease.

Demonetisation could also help tax administration in another way, by shifting transactions out of the cash economy into the formal payment system.
Households and firms have begun to shift from cash to electronic payment technologies.
14Q Consider the following statements regarding private goods and public goods
1. Public goods are collectively consumed.
2. Private goods are non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
Government provides certain goods and services which cannot be provided by the market mechanism i.e. by exchange between individual consumers and producers. Examples of such goods are national defence, roads, government administration etc. which are referred to as public goods. To understand why public goods need to be provided by the government, we must understand the difference between private goods such as clothes, cars, food items etc. and public goods. There are two major differences. One, the benefits of public goods are available to all and are not only restricted to one particular consumer. For example, if a person eats a chocolate or wears a shirt, these will not be available to others. It is said that this person’s consumption stands in rival relationship to the consumption of others. However, if we consider a public park or measures to reduce air pollution, the benefits will be available to all.






One person’s consumption of a good does not reduce the amount available for consumption for others and so several people can enjoy the benefits, that is, the consumption of many people is not ‘rivalrous’.
Two, in case of private goods anyone who does not pay for the goods can be excluded from enjoying its benefits. If you do not buy a ticket, you will not be allowed to watch a movie at a local cinema hall. However, in case of public goods, there is no feasible way of excluding anyone from enjoying the benefits of the good. That is why public goods are called non excludable. Even if some users do not pay, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to collect fees for the public good. These nonpaying users are known as ‘free-riders’. Consumers will not voluntarily pay for what they can get for free and for which there is no exclusive title to the property being enjoyed. The link between the producer and consumer which occurs through the payment process is broken and the government must step in to provide for such goods.

Public goods, as distinct from private goods, are collectively consumed. Two important features of public goods are – they are non-rivalrous in that one person can increase her satisfaction from the good without reducing that obtained by others and they are non-excludable, and there is no feasible way of excluding anyone from enjoying the benefits of the good. These make it difficult to collect fees for their use and private enterprise will in general not provide these goods. Hence, they must be provided by the government. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
15Q Which of the following forms the part of Capital Receipts?
1. Recovery of loans
2. Sale of shares in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)
3. Fresh loans given by Government.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 onlyRecovery of loans
(B)2 and 3 onlyOther receipts (mainly PSU disinvestment)
(C)1 and 3 onlyBorrowings and other liabilities
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
Fresh loans given by Government forms the part of Capital expenditure. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
Capital Receipts: The government also receives money by way of loans or from the sale of its assets. Loans will have to be returned to the agencies from which they have been borrowed. Thus they create liability. Sale of government assets, like sale of shares in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) which is referred to as PSU disinvestment, reduce the total amount of financial assets of the government. All those receipts of the government which create liability or reduce financial assets are termed as capital receipts. When government takes fresh loans it will mean that in future these loans will have to be returned and interest will have to be paid on these loans. Similarly, when government sells an asset, then it means that in future its earnings from that asset, will disappear. Thus, these receipts can be debt creating or non-debt creating.
Capital Receipts (a+b+c)
16Q Consider the following statements regarding Revenue Expenditure
1. Revenue Expenditure is expenditure incurred for purposes other than the creation of physical or financial assets of the central government.
2. Grants given to state governments by central government forms the part of Revenue Expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Revenue Expenditure
Revenue Expenditure is expenditure incurred for purposes other than the creation of physical or financial assets of the central government. It relates to those expenses incurred for the normal functioning of the government departments and various services, interest payments on debt incurred by the government, and grants given to state governments and other parties (even though some of the grants may be meant for creation of assets).
Interest payments on market loans, external loans and from various reserve funds constitute the single largest component of non-plan revenue expenditure. Defence expenditure, is committed expenditure in the sense that given the national security concerns, there exists little scope for drastic reduction. Subsidies are an important policy instrument which aim at increasing welfare. Apart from providing implicit subsidies through underpricing of public goods and services like education and health, the government also extends subsidies explicitly on items such as exports, interest on loans, food and fertilisers.
Revenue Expenditure
17Q Consider the following statements regarding Revenue deficit
1. When the government incurs a revenue deficit, it implies that the government is using up the savings of the other sectors of the economy to finance a part of its consumption expenditure.
2. Increase in revenue deficit can lead to lower growth in economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
When a government spends more than it collects by way of revenue, it incurs a budget deficit. There are various measures that capture government deficit and they have their own implications for the economy.
Revenue Deficit: The revenue deficit refers to the excess of government’s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts
Revenue deficit = Revenue expenditure – Revenue receipts
The revenue deficit includes only such transactions that affect the current income and expenditure of the government. When the government incurs a revenue deficit, it implies that the government is dissaving and is using up the savings of the other sectors of the economy to finance a part of its consumption expenditure. This situation means that the government will have to borrow not only to finance its investment but also its consumption requirements. This will lead to a build up of stock of debt and interest liabilities and force the government, eventually, to cut expenditure. Since a major part of revenue expenditure is committed expenditure, it cannot be reduced. Often the government reduces productive capital expenditure or welfare expenditure. This would mean lower growth and adverse welfare implications.
18Q Consider the following statements regarding inflation target
1. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) constituted by the Central Government determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target.
2. The inflation target is set by the Reserve Bank, once in every five years.
3. The current inflation target is 6% Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
Monetary policy refers to the policy of the central bank with regard to the use of monetary instruments under its control to achieve the goals specified in the Act.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the responsibility of conducting monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable growth.
In May 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 was amended to provide a statutory basis for the implementation of the flexible inflation targeting framework.
The amended RBI Act also provides for the inflation target to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, once in every five years. Accordingly, the Central Government has notified in the Official Gazette 4 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5, 2016 to March 31, 2021 with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 per cent. Hence, both statement 1 and 2 are incorrect.
The Central Government notified the following as factors that constitute failure to achieve the inflation target:(a) the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of the inflation target for any three consecutive quarters; or (b) the average inflation is less than the lower tolerance level for any three consecutive quarters.






Prior to the amendment in the RBI Act in May 2016, the flexible inflation targeting framework was governed by an Agreement on Monetary Policy Framework between the Government and the Reserve Bank of India of February 20, 2015.
The Monetary Policy Process
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) constituted by the Central Government under Section 45ZB determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target.
The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy, and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process for arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate.
The Financial Market Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of monetary policy (weighted average lending rate) is kept close to the policy repo rate.
19Q Which of the following are the features of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBMA)?

ANS: D
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBMA)
In a multi-party parliamentary system, electoral concerns play an important role in determining expenditure policies. A legislative provision, it is argued, that is applicable to all governments – present and future – is likely to be effective in keeping deficits under control.






The enactment of the FRBMA, in August 2003, marked a turning point in fiscal reforms, binding the government through an institutional framework to pursue a prudent fiscal policy. The central government must ensure intergenerational equity and long-term macro-economic stability by achieving sufficient revenue surplus, removing fiscal obstacles to monetary policy and effective debt management by limiting deficits and borrowing. The rules under the Act were notified with effect from July, 2004.
Main Features
1. The Act mandates the central government to take appropriate measures to reduce fiscal deficit to not more than 3 percent of GDP and to eliminate the revenue deficit by March 31, 2009 and thereafter build up adequate revenue surplus.
2. It requires the reduction in fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent of GDP each year and the
revenue deficit by 0.5 per cent. If this is not achieved through tax revenues, the necessary adjustment has to come from a reduction in expenditure.
3. The actual deficits may exceed the targets specified only on grounds of national security or natural calamity or such other exceptional grounds as the central government may specify.
4. The central government shall not borrow from the Reserve Bank of India except by way of advances to meet temporary excess of cash disbursements over cash receipts.
5. The Reserve Bank of India must not subscribe to the primary issues of central government securities from the year 2006-07.
6. Measures to be taken to ensure greater transparency in fiscal operations.
7. The central government to lay before both Houses of Parliament three statements – Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, The Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, The Macroeconomic Framework Statement along with the Annual Financial Statement.
8. Quarterly review of the trends in receipts and expenditure in relation to the budget be placed before both Houses of Parliament.
20Q Consider the following statements regarding Goods and Service Tax (GST)

ANS: C
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Goods and Service Tax (GST) is the single comprehensive indirect tax, operational from 1 July 2017, on supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer/ service provider to the consumer. It is a destination-based consumption tax with facility of Input Tax Credit in the supply chain. It is applicable throughout the country with one rate for one type of goods/service. It has amalgamated a large number of Central and State taxes and cesses. It
has replaced large number of taxes on goods and services levied on production/sale of goods or provision of service.
It has replaced various types of taxes/cesses, levied by the Central and State/UT Governments. Some of the major taxes that were levied by Centre were Central Excise Duty, Service Tax, Central Sales Tax, Cesses like KKC and SBC. The major State taxes were VAT/Sales Tax, Entry Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi, Entertainment Tax, Taxes on Advertisements, Taxes on Lottery /Betting/ Gambling, State Cesses on goods etc. These have been subsumed in GST.
Five petroleum products have been kept out of GST for the time being but with passage of time, they will get subsumed in GST. State Governments will continue to levy VAT on alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Tobacco and tobacco products will attract both GST and Central Excise Duty. Under GST, there are 6 (six) standard rates applied i.e. 0%, 3%,5%, 12%,18% and 28% on supply of all goods and/or services across the country.
The 101th Constitution Amendment Act received assent of the President of India on 8 September, 2016. The amendment introduced Article 246A in the Constitution cross empowering Parliament and Legislatures of States to make laws with reference to Goods and Service Tax imposed by the Union and the States. Thereafter CGST Act, UTGST Act and SGST Acts were enacted for GST.

About World Happiness Report:
It is released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations by the UN General Assembly. Hence, option (a) is correct.
It is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how






happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.
What’s special about the 2020 report?
This is the eighth World Happiness Report. The 2020 report for the first time ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect our happiness.
How the countries are ranked?
Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0.

In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, and other topics.
Interconnections between law, governance and happiness: Why do these connections matter?
Happiness has come to be accepted as a goal of public policy. And this discourse has given a fillip to a new narrative where the interconnections between law, governance and happiness are being searched.
Experiences from several nations confirm that the countries with higher GDP and higher per capita income are not necessarily the happiest countries and there exists a link between the state of happiness and rule of law.
The WHRs, over the years, confirmed that people tend to have:
1. Poor mental health.
2. A low score of subjective well-being.
3. Poor perception about the governance and law and order, despite high income levels. Performance of various countries:
1. Finland is the world’s happiest nation for the third year running.
2. Nordic states dominated the top 10, along with countries such as Switzerland, New Zealand and Austria.

Human Development Index
Context: UNDP has released the annual HDI 2019 report.
The focus of the 2019 Report is on ‘Inequality in Human Development’.
All the above are correct.
India’s position:
India’s rank- 129. Last year’s rank- 130.
Despite lifting 271 million people out of poverty between 2005-15, India still remains home to 28% (364 million) of the world’s poor.
Between 1990 and 2018, India’s HDI value increased by 50 per cent (from 0.431 to 0.647), which places it above the average for countries in the medium human






development group (0.634) and above the average for other South Asian countries (0.642).
This means that in the last three decades, life expectancy at birth in India increased by 11.6 years, whereas the average number of schooling years increased by 3.5 years. Per capita incomes increased 250 times.
India is only marginally better than the South Asian average on the Gender Development Index (0.829 vs 0.828), and ranks at a low 122 (of 162) countries on the 2018 Gender Inequality Index.
India’s neighbours:

Sri Lanka (71) and China (85),
Bhutan (134), Bangladesh (135), Myanmar (145), Nepal (147), Pakistan (152) and Afghanistan (170).
Global scenario:
Norway, Switzerland, Ireland occupied the top three positions in that order. Globally, there are 1.3 billion poor people.
Around 661 million of these poor people live in Asia and the Pacific.
South Asia constitutes 41% of the world’s poor.
Changing nature of inequality:
As the number of people coming out of poverty is increasing, the world is veering towards another type of poverty.
The old inequalities were based on access to health services and education whereas the next generation of poverty is based on technology, education and climate.
What is HDI?
Published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), it is a statistical tool used to measure a country’s overall achievement in its social and economic dimensions. The






social and economic dimensions of a country are based on the health of people, their level of education attainment and their standard of living.
It is part of the Human Development Report.
The other indices that form the part of the 2019 Report are:
1. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI),
2. Gender Development Index (GDI),

3. Gender Inequality Index (GII) and
4. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).
HDI measures average achievement of a country in three basic dimensions of human development:
1. A long and healthy life.
2. Access to knowledge.
3. A decent standard of living.

SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
The different measures used for controlling inflation are explained below.
1. Monetary Measures:
The government of a country takes several measures and formulates policies to control economic activities. Monetary policy is one of the most commonly used measures taken by the government to control inflation.
In monetary policy, the central bank increases rate of interest on borrowings for commercial banks. As a result, commercial banks increase their rate of interests on credit for the public. In such a situation, individuals prefer to save money instead of investing in new ventures.
This would reduce money supply in the market, which, in turn, controls inflation. Apart from this, the central bank reduces the credit creation capacity of commercial banks to control inflation.
The monetary policy of a country involves the following:
26Q Consider the following statements regarding Core inflation

(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Core inflation
This nomenclature is based on the inclusion or exclusion of the goods and services while calculating inflation. Popular in western economies, core inflation shows price rise in all goods and services excluding energy and food articles. In India, it was first time used in the financial year 2000–01 when the government expressed that it was under control—it means the prices of manufactured goods were under control.22 This was criticized by experts on account of excluding food articles and energy out of the inflation and feeling satisfied on the inflation front. Basically, in the western economies, food and energy are not the problems for the masses, while in India these two segments are of most vital importance for the common people.






Definition: An inflation measure which excludes transitory or temporary price volatility as in the case of some commodities such as food items, energy products etc. It reflects the inflation trend in an economy.
Description: A dynamic consumption basket is considered the basis to obtain core inflation. Some goods and commodities have extremely volatile price movements. Core inflation is calculated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by excluding such commodities. The term core inflation was coined by Eckstein (1981) who defined it as ‘the trend increase of the cost of factors of production’ that ‘originates in the long-term expectations of inflation in the minds of households and businesses, in the contractual arrangements which sustain the wage-price momentum, and in the tax system’. The concept of core inflation became popular in the 1970s during periods of high inflation and now normally refers to that component of inflation that is likely to persist for a long period, say, for several years and, therefore, useful for near-term and medium-term
inflation forecasting [Blender (1997); and Byran and Ceechetti (1994)]. most core measures are based on the concept that total inflation can be separated into two components: the core part, representing the underlying trend of inflation as shaped by the pressure of aggregate demand against capacity, and the non-core part, which reflects price movements caused by temporary shocks or relative price changes[(Lafleche (2006)].
A good measure of core inflation should have three properties. first, core measure of inflation should be more stable or less volatile than headline inflation. Second, over a long period of time, average rate of core inflation should match the average rate of headline inflation and there should be no systematic divergence between the two. Also, core inflation should be able to track the trend rate of inflation. Third, if core inflation represents the underlying trend of inflation, it should then be better able to predict total or headline inflation. It is expected that core measures contain more information about the future trend of inflation than the headline inflation.

Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Maternity Benefit Programme that is implemented in all the districts of the country in accordance with the provision of the National Food Security Act, 2013.
Objectives
1. Providing partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentive, so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child.
2. The cash incentive provided would lead to improved health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW& LM).

Target beneficiaries
1. All Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers, excluding PW&LM who are in regular employment with the Central Government or the State Governments or PSUs or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being in force. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
2. All eligible Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who have their pregnancy on or after 01.01.2017 for first child in family. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
3. The date and stage of pregnancy for a beneficiary would be counted with respect to her LMP date as mentioned in the MCP card.
4. Case of Miscarriage/Still Birth :
A beneficiary is eligible to receive benefits under the scheme only once.
In case of miscarriage/still birth, the beneficiary would be eligible to claim the remaining instalment(s) in event of any future pregnancy.
Thus, after receiving the 1st instalment, if the beneficiary has a miscarriage, she would only be eligible for receiving 2nd and 3rd instalment in event of future pregnancy subject to fulfilment of eligibility criterion and conditionalities of the scheme. Similarly, if the beneficiary has a miscarriage or still birth after receiving 1 st and 2nd instalments, she would only be eligible for receiving 3rd instalment in event of future pregnancy subject to fulfilment of eligibility criterion and
conditionalities of the scheme.






5. Case of Infant Mortality: A beneficiary is eligible to receive benefits under the scheme only once. That is, in case of infant mortality, she will not be eligible for claiming benefits under the scheme, if she has already received all the instalments of the maternity benefit under PMMVY earlier.
6. Pregnant and Lactating AWWs/ AWHs/ ASHA may also avail the benefits under the PMMVY subject to fulfilment of scheme conditionalities.
Benefits under PMMVY
Cash incentive of Rs 5000 in three instalments i.e. first instalment of Rs 1000/ - on early registration of pregnancy at the Anganwadi Centre (AWC) / approved
Health facility as may be identified by the respective administering State / UT, second instalment of Rs 2000/ - after six months of pregnancy on receiving at least one ante-natal check-up (ANC) and third instalment of Rs 2000/ - after child birth is registered and the child has received the first cycle of BCG, OPV, DPT and Hepatitis - B, or its equivalent/ substitute.
The eligible beneficiaries would receive the incentive given under the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) for Institutional delivery and the incentive received under JSY would be accounted towards maternity benefits so that on an average a woman gets Rs 6000 / - .

Under Article 102 (1) and Article 191 (1) of the Constitution, an MP or an MLA (or an MLC) is barred from holding any office of profit under the Central or State government.
Why in News?
The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Office of Profit is deliberating on whether an MP can continue to teach at a university and if this draws the provisions of “Office of Profit” rules.
What is an ‘office of profit’?

If an MLA or an MP holds a government office and receives benefits from it, then that office is termed as an “office of profit”.
A person will be disqualified if he holds an office of profit under the central or state government, other than an office declared not to disqualify its holder by a law passed by Parliament or state legislature.
What is the underlying principle for including ‘office of profit’ as criterion for disqualification?
1. Makers of the Constitution wanted that legislators should not feel obligated to the Executive in any way, which could influence them while discharging legislative functions.
2. In other words, an MP or MLA should be free to carry out her duties without any kind of governmental pressure. The intent is that there should be no conflict between the duties and interests of an elected member.
3. The office of profit law simply seeks to enforce a basic feature of the Constitution- the principle of separation of power between the legislature and the executive.
Reasons for controversies:
The expression “office of profit” has not been defined in the Constitution or in the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
It is for the courts to explain the significance and meaning of this concept. Over the years, courts have decided this issue in the context of specific factual situations.

29Q Consider the following statements regarding Seigniorage

2. It is essentially the profit earned by the government by printing currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: C
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Definition: Seigniorage is the difference between the value of currency/money and the cost of producing it. It is essentially the profit earned by the government by printing currency.
Description: It can also be termed as a source of revenue for governments as the value of money printed is generally higher than the cost of producing it. As obvious, if the currency produced values more than the cost involved in its production, the government earns a profit. If the cost involved in its production crosses its value, then the government suffers a loss.
Inflation tax
Inflation erodes the value of money and the people who hold currency suffer in this process. As the governments have authority of printing currency and circulating it into the economy (as they do in the case of deficit financing), this act functions as an income to the governments. This is a situation of sustaining government expenditure at the cost of people’s income. This looks as if inflation is working as a tax. That is how the term inflation tax is also known as seigniorage. It means, inflation is always the level to which the government may go for deficit financing—level of deficit financing is directly reflected by the rate of inflation.
It could also be used by the governments in the form of prices and incomes policy under which the companies pay inflation tax on the salary increases above the set level prescribed by the government.
There is a heated debate about the RBI’s decision to slash its dividend payout to the Centre by half, to ₹30,659 crore. Analysts have come up with a battery of reasons from the higher interest costs paid by the RBI to banks after demonetisation, to a bigger transfer to the






contingency reserve to the loss incurred on seignorage. The last is the surprise element because seigniorage usually results in windfall profits for central banks and governments.
What is it?
Seigniorage is a fancy term for the profits governments make by minting currency. It is the difference between the face value of a currency note or coin, and its actual production cost. For instance, if the cost of printing a ₹2,000-note is about ₹4, printing one such note and putting it into circulation fetches a profit of ₹1,996. Usually central banks ‘earn’ this profit and transfer it to the Government.
It is normal to assume that whenever the it issues new currency, the RBI will pocket a profit. Higher denomination notes earn higher profits. However, things are different in the case of coins where the cost of minting can is usually equal to the face value, and can fluctuate based on the price of base metal.
30Q Under stagflation, the economy faces
1. Stagnant growth
2. Rising inflation
3. High employment

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
1. So, what exactly is stagflation?
Stagflation is the extreme economic situation, a peculiar combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation leading to high unemployment. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect. Generally, rising inflation is a sign of a fast-growing economy as people have more money to spend higher amounts on the same quality of goods. Similarly, when the economic growth stalls, inflation is supposed to go down. And as a result of this stalled economic growth unemployment tends to go up.
2. Is there an example from the past?
In the mid-1970s, stagflation was used to describe the period when the United States faced a prolonged slump and high unemployment along with rising inflation. It was mainly on the back of OPEC's decision to cut oil supplies. As a result, the oil prices reached the new heights and hampering productive capacity. The US Fed tried to






address the issue by rate cuts and boosting money supply but output couldn't rise much due to low productivity and oil shortage. So, all that extra money just triggered inflation. This peculiar situation gave a second thought to the popular Keynesian philosophy of that time. According to Keynesian philosophy, inflation should have an inverse relationship with unemployment, and an affirmative relationship with economic growth.
3. Why is it dangerous?
The situation is dangerous mainly because in normal low growth situation the government or the central bank can provide economic stimulus via higher public spending and cut interest rates. But the catch is that when inflation is already running high, fiscal and monetary stimulus can make it worse as that puts more money in the hands of the consumer.

4. Is India in a stagflationary phase?
India may not have yet entered stagflationary phase as of now. The US economic growth between 1973-75 saw five quarters of negative growth and tripling of inflation to be regarded as stagflationary. We may not be in a stagflationary scenario but slowing growth which is a far cry from what India's potential is will pose a risk to government's $5 trillion goal. Come February 1, all eyes will be on the Union Budget as an opportunity to turn the tide for the economy.
31Q Which of the following shows the graphical representation of income inequality or wealth inequality?
(A)Engel's Law
(B)Lorenz Curve
(C)Rahn curve
(D)Laffer Curve
ANS: A
SOL:
What Is a Lorenz Curve?
A Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of income inequality or wealth inequality developed by American economist Max Lorenz in 1905. Hence, option (a) is correct.
The graph plots percentiles of the population on the horizontal axis according to income or wealth. It plots cumulative income or wealth on the vertical axis, so that an x-value of 45 and a y-value of 14.2 would mean that the bottom 45% of the population controls 14.2% of the total income or wealth. In practice, a Lorenz curve is usually a mathematical function estimated from an incomplete set of observations of income or wealth.






A Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or wealth within a population.
Lorenz curves graph percentiles of the population against cumulative income or wealth of people at or below that percentile.
Lorenz curves, along with their derivative statistics, are widely used to measure inequality across a population.
Because Lorenz curves are mathematical estimates based on fitting a continuous curve to incomplete and discontinuous data, they may be imperfect measures of true inequality.

What Is Engel's Law
Engel's Law is an economic theory introduced in 1857 by Ernst Engel, a German statistician, stating that the percentage of income allocated for food purchases decreases as income rises. As a household's income increases, the percentage of income spent on food decreases while the proportion spent on other goods (such as luxury goods) increases.

Engel's Law is a 19th century observation that as household income increases, the percentage of that income spent on food declines on a relative basis.
This is because the amount and quality of food a family can consume in a week or month is fairly limited in price and quantity.
As food consumption declines, luxury consumption and savings increase in turn.
The Rahn curve is a graph used to illustrate an economic theory, proposed in 1996 by American economist Richard W. Rahn, which suggests that there is a level of government spending that maximizes economic growth. The theory is used by classical liberals to argue for a decrease in overall government spending and taxation. The inverted-U-shaped curve suggests that the optimal level of government spending is 15–25% of GDP.
32Q Consider the following statements
1. The Phillips curve is an economic concept developed to show the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments.
2. The Laffer Curve is an economic concept that stats that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: D
SOL:
What is the Phillips Curve?
The Phillips curve is an economic concept developed by A. W. Phillips stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The theory claims that with economic growth comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment. However, the original concept has been somewhat






disproven empirically due to the occurrence of stagflation in the 1970s, when there were high levels of both inflation and unemployment.
Key Takeaways
The Phillips curve states that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. Higher inflation is associated with lower unemployment and vice versa.
The Phillips curve was a concept used to guide macroeconomic policy in the 20th century, but was called into question by the stagflation of the 1970's.
Understanding the Phillips curve in light of consumer and worker expectations, shows
that the relationship between inflation and unemployment may not hold in the long run, or even potentially in the short run.
What is the Laffer Curve?
The Laffer Curve is a theory developed by supply-side economist Arthur Laffer to show the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments. The curve is used to illustrate Laffer’s argument that sometimes cutting tax rates can increase total tax revenue. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Key Takeaways
The Laffer Curve describes the relationship between tax rates and total tax revenue, with an optimal tax rate that maximizes total government tax revenue.
If taxes are too high along the Laffer Curve, then they will discourage the taxed activities, such as work and investment, enough to actually reduce total tax revenue. In this case, cutting tax rates will both stimulate economic incentives and increase tax revenue.
The Laffer Curve was used as a basis for tax cuts in the 1980's with apparent success, but criticized on practical grounds on the basis of its simplistic assumptions, and on economic grounds that increasing government revenue might not always be optimal.
33Q Which of the following is/are the Effects of Inflation?
1. Inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors, i.e., lenders suffer and borrowers benefit out of inflation.
2. Holding money remains an intelligent economic decision during inflation.
3. With inflation, the currency of the economy depreciates.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: C
SOL:
Effects of Inflation

There are multi-dimensional effects of inflation on an economy both at the micro and macro levels. It redistributes income, distorts relative prices, destabilizes employment, tax, saving and investment policies, and finally it may bring in recession and depression in an economy. A brief and objective overview of the effects of inflation is given below:
1. On Creditors and Debtors
Inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors, i.e., lenders suffer and borrowers benefit out of inflation. The opposite effect takes place when inflation falls (i.e., deflation).
2. On lending
With the rise in inflation, lending institutions feel the pressure of higher lending. Institutions don’t revise the nominal rate of interest as the ‘real cost of borrowing’ (i.e., nominal rate of interest minus inflation) falls by the same percentage with which inflation rises.
3. On Aggregate Demand
Rising inflation indicates rising aggregate demand and indicates comparatively lower supply and higher purchasing capacity among the consumers. Usually, higher inflation suggests the producers to increase their production level as it is generally considered as an indication of higher demand in the economy.
On Income
Inflation affects the income of individual and firms alike. An increase in inflation, increases the ‘nominal’ value of income, while the ‘real’ value of income remains the same. Increased price levels erode the purchasing power of the money in the short-run, but in the long-run the income levels also increase (making the nominal value of income going upward)
6. On Saving
Holding money does not remain an intelligent economic decision (because money






loses value with every increase in inflation) that is why people visit banks more frequently and try to hold least money with themselves and put maximum with the banks in their saving accounts. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
9. On Exchange Rate
With every inflation the currency of the economy depreciates (loses its exchange value in front of a foreign currency) provided it follows the flexible currency regime. Though it is a comparative matter, there might be inflationary pressure on the foreign currency against which the exchange
rate is compared.
34Q Which of the following statement regarding Wholesale Price index is incorrect?
(A)It is published by the office of the Economic Adviser.
(B)The prices used for compilation includes indirect taxes, in order to remove impact of fiscal policy.
(C)Current base year is 2011–12.
(D)Highest weightage under WPI is for Manufactured products.
ANS: B
SOL:
Wholesale Price index
The first index number of wholesale prices commenced in India for the week January 10, 1942. It was having the base week ending August 19, 1939 = 100, which was published by the office of the Economic Adviser to the Government of India (Ministry of Industry). Independent India followed the same series with more number of commodities included in the index. Several changes regarding inclusion of commodities, assigning them the logical weights took place in the coming times including revisions in the base years for the WPI. The WPI base year has been revised five times till date.
The Office of the Economic Adviser, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is releasing index numbers of wholesale price in India. Current base year: 2011–12 Base Year (697 Commodities) released in May 2017.
Revised WPI
The new series of the WPI was released by the Government with the revised base year as 2011-12. The existing base year was 2004-05. The new base year aligns with the base year of other indicators like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Index of Industrial Production






(IIP).
A Working Group was set up (March 2012) by the Government to advise on the new series of the WPI (headed by Saumitra Chaudhuri, Member, erstwhile Planning Commission).
Key highlights of the revised series are as given below:
WPI continues to constitute three major groups—Primary Articles, Fuel and
Power, and Manufactured Products. The number of items has been increased from 676 to 697—in all 199 new items have been added and 146 old items have been dropped.

It is more representative with increase in number of quotations from 5482 to 8331—an increase by 2849 quotations (52 per cent).
The prices used for compilation do not include indirect taxes in order to remove impact of fiscal policy. Hence, option (b) is correct. This is in consonance with international practices and will make the new WPI conceptually closer to Producer Price Index (PPI).
Item level aggregates for new WPI have been compiled using Geometric Mean (GM) following international best practice and as is currently used for compilation of the CPI C.
The major changes in weights, number of items and quotations between WPI 2004-05 and WPI 2011-12 are given in the Table 7.1.

36Q Consider the following statements regarding NHB RESIDEX
1. It is India’s first official housing price index and an initiative of the National Housing Bank (NHB).
2. The geographical coverage consists of all cities in India.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(A)1 only
(B)2 only
(C)Both 1 and 2
(D)Neither 1 nor 2
ANS: A
SOL:
NHB RESIDEX, India’s first official housing price index, was an initiative of the National Housing Bank (NHB) undertaken at the behest of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The index was formulated under the guidance of a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of stakeholders from the housing market. It was launched in July, 2007 and updated periodically till March 2015, taking 2007 as the base year. During this period, the coverage of NHB RESIDEX was expanded gradually to 26 cities. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Initially, NHB RESIDEX was computed using market data, which 2010 onwards, was shifted to valuation data received from banks and housing finance companies (HFCs). Thereafter, data was sourced from Central Registry of Securitization Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) from 2013 to 2015.

With a view to make the NHB RESIDEX more current and up-to-date with the prevailing macro-economic scenario, NHB undertook a review of the processes and methodology used for computation of the index along with the base year and segmentation used.
Thereafter revamped NHB RESIDEX with larger scope and wider geographical coverage was published. This index is computed taking FY2012-13 as base year and is updated up to March 2018. With effect from April 2018, a new series with FY2017-18 as new base year has been published and is updated. In order to maintain continuity in the time series data, NHB RESIDEX 2012-13 series subsequent to change in base year has been calculated using backward linking factor.
Housing Price Indices (HPI)
The HPI represents the price changes in residential housing properties. At present, the geographical coverage consists of 50 cities in India including 18 State/UT capitals and 37 smart cities, which will progressively be expanded to over 100 cities including all State/UT capitals and smart cities.
37Q Which of the following is/are the major traits of Recession?

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
Recession
This is somewhat similar to the phase of ‘depression’ — we may call it a mild form of depression — fatal for economies as this may lead to depression if not handled with care and in time. The financial crises which followed the US ‘sub-prime crisis’ in almost the whole Euro American economies has basically brought in ‘severe recessionary’ trends there. Major traits of recession, to a great extent, are similar to that of ‘depression’—may be summed up as follows:
(i) there is a general fall in demand as economic activities takes a downturn;
(ii) inflation remains lower or/and shows further signs of falling down;
(iii) employment rate falls/unemployment rate grows; Hence, statement 3 is incorrect. (iv) Industries resort to ‘price cuts’ to sustain their business.
In the financial year 1996–97, the Indian economy was taken up by the cycle of recession— basically due to a general downturn in domestic as well as foreign demands, initiated by the South East Asian Currency Crisis of mid-1990s. The whole plan of economic reforms in India was derailed and it was only by the end of 2001–02 that the economy was able to recover.
38Q Which of the following is/are the major traits of Recovery phase business cycle?
1. An upturn in aggregate (total) demand.
2. Inflation moves upward making borrowing cheaper for investors.
3. Unemployment rate starts declining.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: D
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Recovery
An economy tries to come out of the low production phase to survive. The low production phase might be depression, recession or slowdown with the former being the worst and rare, governments take many new fiscal and monetary measures to boost demand and production






and ultimately a recovery in an economy is managed. The business cycle of recovery may show the following major economy traits:
(i) an upturn in aggregate (total) demand which has to be accompanied by increase in the level of production;
(ii) production process expands and new investments become attractive;
(iii) as demand goes upward, inflation also moves upward making borrowing cheaper for investors;
(iv) with an upturn in production, new employment avenues are created and unemployment rate starts declining; etc.
With the above symptoms, people’s income go for a certain increase which creates new
demand and a cycle of demand and production (supply) starts playing hand-in-hand to recover the economy. To recover an economy, governments usually go for tax-breaks, interest cuts, an increase in salaries of its employees, etc. Assimilation of innovations by the entrepreneurs and search for new frontiers of enterprise do play a very vital role in the process of recovery
provided these activities are at first incentives by the governments.
The Euro-American economies recovered out of the Great Depression with the help of the measures cited above. Such recoveries have been seen many times around the world when economies recovered from slowdown or the recessionary phases. The best example of recent times could be cited from India of 1997 to 2002 when the economy suffered severe bouts of slowdown and recession.
39Q Which of the following statement regarding payments bank is incorrect?
(A)The payments bank will be registered as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013.
(B)The payments bank required to invest minimum 75 per cent of its "demand deposit balances" in Government securities/Treasury Bills.
(C)Payments bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of Rs. 10,00,000 per individual customer.
(D)Payment banks cannot issue credit cards.
ANS: C
SOL:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issues licences to entities to carry on the business of banking and other businesses in which banking companies may engage, as defined and described in Sections 5 (b) and 6 (1) (a) to (o) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, respectively.






Registration, licensing and regulations
The payments bank will be registered as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013, and licensed under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, with specific licensing conditions restricting its activities mainly to acceptance of demand deposits and provision of payments and remittance services. It will be governed by the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999; Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007; Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961.
Scope of activities
The payments bank will be set up as a differentiated bank and shall confine its activities to further the objectives for which it is set up. Therefore, the payments bank would be permitted
to set up its own outlets such as branches, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), Business Correspondents (BCs), etc. to undertake only certain restricted activities permitted to banks under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as given below:
i. Acceptance of demand deposits, i.e., current deposits, and savings bank deposits from individuals, small businesses and other entities, as permitted. No NRI deposits should be accepted. The eligible deposits mobilised by the payments bank would be covered under the deposit insurance scheme of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC). Given that their primary role is to provide payments and remittance services and demand deposit products to small businesses and low-income households, payments bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of Rs. 100,000 per individual customer. Hence, option (c) is correct.
After the performance of the payments bank is gauged, RBI may consider raising the maximum balance limit. However, payments bank can accept a large pool of money to be remitted to a number of accounts provided at the end of the day the balance does not exceed Rs. 100, 000. If the transactions in the accounts conform to the “small accounts”1 transactions, simplified KYC/AML/CFT norms will be applicable to such accounts as defined under the Rules framed under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002. The payments bank will have to undertake its own KYC/AML/CFT exercise as any other bank.
ii. Issuance of ATM / Debit Cards. Payments banks, however, cannot issue credit cards.
iii. Payments and remittance services through various channels including branches, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), Business Correspondents (BCs) and mobile banking. The payments / remittance services would include acceptance of funds at one end through various channels including branches and BCs and payments of cash at the other end, through branches, BCs, and ATMs. Cash-out can also be permitted at Point-of-Sale terminal locations as per extant instructions issued under the PSS Act. Payments banks can be part of any card payment network (other than credit cards) that is authorised under the PSS Act. In the case of walk-in customers, the bank should follow the extant KYC guidelines issued by the RBI.
iv. Issuance of PPIs as per instructions issued from time to time under the PSS Act. However,






the outstanding balances in PPIs will be deployed as per the pattern of deployment of funds indicated at paragraph 5 below.
v. Internet banking - The RBI is also open to payments bank offering Internet banking services. The payments bank is expected to leverage technology to offer low cost banking solutions. Such a bank should ensure that it has all enabling systems in place including business partners, third party service providers and risk management systems and controls to enable offering transactional services on the internet. It may be clarified that RBI does not envisage payments banks to be “virtual” banks or branchless banks. Therefore, while offering internet banking services, the payments bank will be required to comply with RBI instructions on internet banking; and information security, electronic banking, technology risk management and cyber frauds.
vi. Functioning as Business Correspondent (BC) of another bank – A payments bank may
choose to become a BC of another bank, subject to the RBI guidelines on BCs.
vii. As a channel, the payments bank can accept remittances to be sent to or receive remittances from multiple banks under a payment mechanism approved by RBI, such as RTGS / NEFT / IMPS.
viii. Payments banks will be permitted to handle cross border remittance transactions in the nature of personal payments / remittances on the current account. All facilities / approvals incidental to undertaking such transactions in foreign exchange will be enabled by RBI on an application made to it.
ix. Payments banks can undertake other non-risk sharing simple financial services activities, not requiring any commitment of their own funds, such as distribution of mutual fund units, insurance products, pension products, etc. with the prior approval of the RBI and after complying with the requirements of the sectoral regulator for such products.
x. The payments bank may undertake utility bill payments etc. on behalf of its customers and general public.
The payments bank cannot set up subsidiaries to undertake non-banking financial services activities. The other financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters, if any, should be kept distinctly ring-fenced and not comingled with the banking and financial services business of the payments bank.
The payments bank will be required to use the words “Payments Bank” in its name in order to differentiate it from other banks.
5. Deployment of funds
The payments bank cannot undertake lending activities. Apart from amounts maintained as Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) with RBI on its outside demand and time liabilities, it will be required to invest minimum 75 per cent of its "demand deposit balances" in Government securities/Treasury Bills with maturity up to one year that are recognized by RBI as eligible securities for maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and hold maximum 25 per cent in current and time / fixed deposits with






other scheduled commercial banks for operational purposes and liquidity management.

41Q Consider the following statements regarding non performing asset (NPA)
1. A non performing asset (NPA) is a loan or advance for which the principal or interest payment remained overdue for a period of 90 days.
2. At present, the gross NPA ratio of all SCBs is around 8.5 per cent.
3. Wilful defaulters constitutes about 55% of the total NPAs under Public Sector Banks.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
(A)1 and 2 only
(B)2 and 3 only
(C)1 and 3 only
(D)1, 2 and 3
ANS: A
SOL:
Definition: A non performing asset (NPA) is a loan or advance for which the principal or interest payment remained overdue for a period of 90 days.
Description: Banks are required to classify NPAs further into Substandard, Doubtful and Loss assets.
1. Substandard assets: Assets which has remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months.
2. Doubtful assets: An asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained in the substandard category for a period of 12 months.
3. Loss assets: As per RBI, “Loss asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that






its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted, although there may be some salvage or recovery value.”
The disruptions led by the coronavirus pandemic has further deteriorated the health of the Indian banking industry, which was already reeling under severe stress in the previous years. India’s NPA ratio is one of the highest among comparable countries and further, it is expected to reach 11-11.5% by the end of the current fiscal year 2020-21, said a report by Care Ratings. The FY21 GNPA numbers would move significantly ahead from the current 8.5 per cent level, but would be lower due to the one-time restructuring scheme, the report added.
Before the loan restructuring was announced by RBI, a Finacial Stability Report released in the month of July showed that the gross NPA ratio of all SCBs may increase from 8.5 per cent in March 2020 to 12.5 per cent by March 2021 under the
baseline scenario. It had added if the macroeconomic environment worsens, the ratio may further escalate to 14.7 per cent under the very severely stressed scenario.
According to Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, wilful defaulters owe Public Sector Banks a total of Rs 64,335 crore, which constitutes about 21% of the total NPAs. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.

ANS: D
SOL:
All the above statements are correct.
Banks, especially government-owned lenders are reeling under pile of bad loans, thanks to economic downturn and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) fiat to accelerate recognition and provisioning for weak assets.
Most companies and individuals that fail to pay up, do so due to slowdown and things going horribly wrong for factors beyond their control.
However, there are some truant borrowers — corporate and individuals — who, despite having the capability to repay money, do not cough up money. They are alleged to be doing it wilfully. For lenders, getting money from them is often a long legal battle.






How does a company or individual become declared as a ‘wilful defaulter’ and what is its impact? Here‘s a quick tutorial on the scope and meaning of what it means to be identified as a wilful defaulter.
According to the RBI, a wilful default is deemed to have occurred in any of the following four circumstances:
1. When there is a default in repayment obligations by the unit (company/individual) to the lender even when it has the capacity to honour the said obligations. There is deliberate intention of not repaying the loan.
2. The funds are not utilised for the specific purpose for which finance was availed but have been diverted for other purposes.
3. When the funds have been siphoned off and not been utilised for the purpose for
which it was availed. Further, no assets are available which justify the usage of funds.
4. When the asset bought by the lenders’ funds have been sold off without the knowledge of the bank/lender.
Further, in cases where a letter of comfort or guarantees furnished by group companies of wilfully defaulting units are not honoured when they are invoked by the lender, then such group companies are also considered to be wilful defaulters.

Basel Norms
Context: An assessment of compliance with Basel Norms was recently conducted by the Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP). RCAP is part of the Basel committee.
The assessment focused on the completeness and consistency of the domestic regulations in force on 7 June 2019, as applied to commercial banks in India, with the Basel large exposures framework.
Key findings:

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) norms on large exposures for banks are not only compliant with the Basel requirements, they are stricter in some areas as well.
This is highest possible grade. In some other respects, the Indian regulations are stricter than the Basel large exposures framework. For example, banks’ exposures to global systemically important banks are subject to stricter limits, in line with the letter and spirit of the Basel Guidelines, and the scope of application of the Indian standards is wider than just the internationally active banks covered by the Basel framework.
What are Basel guidelines?
BASEL-I:
Introduced in 1988.
Focused almost entirely on credit risk, it defined capital and structure of risk weights for banks.
The minimum capital requirement was fixed at 8% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). India adopted Basel 1 guidelines in 1999.
BASEL-II:
Published in 2004.
The guidelines were based on three parameters:
1. Banks should maintain a minimum capital adequacy requirement of 8% of risk assets.






2. Banks were needed to develop and use better risk management techniques in monitoring and managing all the three types of risks that is credit and increased disclosure requirements. The three types of risk are- operational risk, market risk, capital risk.
3. Banks need to mandatory disclose their risk exposure to the central bank.
Basel III:
In 2010, Basel III guidelines were released. These guidelines were introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2008.
Basel III norms aim at making most banking activities such as their trading book
activities more capital-intensive.
The guidelines aim to promote a more resilient banking system by focusing on four vital banking parameters viz. capital, leverage, funding and liquidity.
Presently Indian banking system follows Basel II norms. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The Basel III norms stipulated a capital to risk weighted assets of 8%. However, as per RBI norms, Indian scheduled commercial banks are required to maintain a CAR of 9% while Indian public sector banks are emphasized to maintain a CAR of 12%.

Balance on Current Account has two components:
Balance of Trade or Trade Balance
Balance on Invisibles
Balance of Trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of exports and value of imports of goods of a country in a given period of time. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Export of goods is entered as a credit item in BOT, whereas import of goods is entered as a
debit item in BOT. It is also known as Trade Balance.
BOT is said to be in balance when exports of goods are equal to the imports of goods. Surplus BOT or Trade surplus will arise if country exports more goods than what it imports. Whereas, Deficit BOT or Trade deficit will arise if a country imports more goods than what it exports.
Net Invisibles is the difference between the value of exports and value of imports of invisibles of a country in a given period of time. Invisibles include services, transfers and flows of income that take place between different countries. Services trade includes both factor and non-factor income. Factor income includes net international earnings on factors of production (like labour, land and capital). Non-factor income is net sale of service products like shipping, banking, tourism, software services, etc.

Capital Account






Capital Account records all international transactions of assets. An asset is any one of the forms in which wealth can be held, for example: money, stocks, bonds, Government debt, etc. Purchase of assets is a debit item on the capital account. If an Indian buy a UK Car Company, it enters capital account transactions as a debit item (as foreign exchange is flowing out of India). On the other hand, sale of assets like sale of share of an Indian company to a Chinese customer is a credit item on the capital account. Fig. 6.2 classifies the items which are a part of capital account transactions. These items are Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), Foreign Institutional Investments (FIIs), external borrowings and assistance.

Balance on Capital Account
Capital account is in balance when capital inflows (like receipt of loans from abroad, sale of assets or shares in foreign companies) are equal to capital outflows (like repayment of loans, purchase of assets or shares in foreign countries). Surplus in capital account arises when capital inflows are greater than capital outflows, whereas deficit in capital account arises when capital inflows are lesser than capital outflows.
49. Consider the following statements
1. At present, about 33% of the female labour are unpaid family labours.
2. In urban areas, Unpaid family labours have increased from 6% in 2011-12 to 9% in 2017-18.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
As per PLFS estimates, the share of regular wage/salaried employees has increased by 5 percentage points from 18 per cent in 2011-12 to 23 per cent in 2017-18 as per usual status (Figure 5). In absolute terms, there was a significant jump of around 2.62 crore new jobs in this category with 1.21 crore in rural areas and 1.39 crore in urban areas (Table 5)4. Remarkably, the proportion of women workers in regular wage/salaried employees’ category have increased by 8 percentage points (from 13 per cent in 2011-12 to 21 per cent in 2017-18) with addition of 0.71 crore new jobs for female workers in this category (Table 5 & Figure 5).

Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.

50Q Consider the following statements regarding exchange rate under fixed exchange rate system 1. When some government action increases the exchange rate (thereby, making domestic






currency cheaper) is called Depreciation.
2. Appreciation is said to occur, when the Government decreases the exchange rate (thereby, making domestic currency costlier) in a fixed exchange rate system.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

In a fixed exchange rate system, when some government action increases the exchange rate (thereby, making domestic currency cheaper) is called Devaluation. On the other hand, a Revaluation is said to occur, when the Government decreases the exchange rate (thereby, making domestic currency costlier) in a fixed exchange rate system. Hence, both statement 1 and 2 are incorrect.
The initial exchange rate e0 = 50, which means that we need to exchange Rs 50 for one dollar. At the new equilibrium, the exchange rate becomes e1 = 70, which means that we need to pay more rupees for a dollar now (i.e., Rs 70). It indicates that the value of rupees in terms of dollars has fallen and value of dollar in terms of rupees has risen. Increase in exchange rate implies that the price of foreign currency (dollar) in terms of domestic currency (rupees) has increased. This is called Depreciation of domestic currency (rupees) in terms of foreign currency (dollars).
Similarly, in a flexible exchange rate regime, when the price of domestic currency (rupees) in terms of foreign currency (dollars) increases, it is called Appreciation of the domestic currency (rupees) in terms of foreign currency (dollars). This means that the value of rupees relative to dollar has risen and we need to pay fewer rupees in exchange for one dollar.
51Q Which of the following are merits of flexible exchange rate system?
1. The main feature of the flexible exchange rate system is that there must be credibility that the government will be able to maintain the exchange rate at the level specified. 2. The movements in the exchange rate automatically take care of the surpluses and deficits in the BoP.
3. Under flexible exchange rate system, the government need not maintain large stocks of foreign exchange reserves.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Merits and Demerits of Flexible and Fixed Exchange Rate Systems
The main feature of the fixed exchange rate system is that there must be credibility that the government will be able to maintain the exchange rate at the level specified. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect. Often, if there is a deficit in the BoP, in a fixed exchange rate system, governments will have to intervene to take care of the gap by use of its official
reserves. If people know that the amount of reserves is inadequate, they would begin to doubt the ability of the government to maintain the fixed rate. This may give rise to speculation of devaluation. When this belief translates into aggressive buying of one currency thereby forcing the government to devalue, it is said to constitute a speculative attack on a currency. Fixed exchange rates are prone to these kinds of attacks, as has been witnessed in the period before the collapse of the Bretton Woods System.
The flexible exchange rate system gives the government more flexibility and they do not need to maintain large stocks of foreign exchange reserves. The major advantage of flexible exchange rates is that movements in the exchange rate automatically take care of the surpluses and deficits in the BoP. Also, countries gain independence in conducting their monetary policies, since they do not have to intervene to maintain exchange rate which are automatically taken care of by the market.
52Q Which of the following institutions were established under Bretton Woods Conference? 1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
2. World Bank
3. World Trade Organization
4. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Select the correct answer using the code given below:
The Bretton Woods System: The Bretton Woods Conference held in 1944 set up the






International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and reestablished a system of fixed exchange rates. Hence, both statement 3 and 4 are incorrect.
This was different from the international gold standard in the choice of the asset in which national currencies would be convertible. A two-tier system of convertibility was established at the centre of which was the dollar. The US monetary authorities guaranteed the convertibility of the dollar into gold at the fixed price of $35 per ounce of gold. The second-tier of the system was the commitment of monetary authority of each IMF member participating in the system to convert their currency into dollars at a fixed price. The latter was called the official exchange rate. For instance, if French francs could be exchanged for dollars at roughly 5 francs per dollar, the dollars could then be exchanged for gold at $35 per ounce, which fixed the value of the franc at 175 francs per ounce of gold (5 francs per dollar times 35 dollars per ounce). A change in exchange rates was to be permitted only in case of a ‘fundamental disequilibrium’ in a nation’s BoP – which came to mean a chronic deficit in the BoP of sizeable proportions.
53Q Consider the following statements regarding Planning Process.
1. The type of planning which gives less emphasis upon the social and institutional dimensions is known as systems planning.
2. Normative planning is a planning from social-technical point of view, but only suitable for a country which has lesser degree of social diversities.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
A major classification of planning is done on the basis of societal emphasis. The type of planning which gives less emphasis upon the social and institutional dimensions is known as systems planning. In such planning, the planners just search for the best possible results in relation to the established goals giving less importance to issues like caste, creed, religion, region, language, marriage, family, etc. Opposed to it, the normative planning gives due importance to the socio-institutional factors. This is a planning from social-technical point of view, but only suitable for a country which has lesser degree of social diversities (naturally, not fit for the Indian conditions). But in the coming years there was a shift in the very thinking of policymakers. The Economic Survey 2010–11 is probably the first document of the Government of India which advocates the need for a normative approach to planning in India. It is believed that until a programme/scheme run by the governments are not able to connect with the customs, traditions and ethos of the






population, their acceptability will not be of the desired level among the target population. Establishing an empathic relationship between the programmes/schemes and target population is now considered an important aspect of planning and policymaking. Such a change in the thinking is based on the experiences of India and other countries of the world.
54Q Consider the following statements regarding Essential Services Maintenance Act
1. It was established to ensure the delivery of certain services, which if obstructed would affect the normal life of the people.
2. Any police officer is empowered to arrest the striking persons without a warrant. 3. The employees can't even refuse to work overtime if their work is considered necessary for the maintenance of any of the essential services.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
Essential Services Maintenance Act
Context:
The Uttar Pradesh government has extended the Essential Services Maintenance Act in the State, banning strikes in all departments and corporations under it for a period of another six months.
About ESMA, 1968:
The Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) is an act of Parliament of India.
Objective: It was established to ensure the delivery of certain services, which if obstructed would affect the normal life of the people.
These include services like public transport (bus services), health services (doctors and hospitals).
ESMA gives police right to arrest without a warrant anybody violating the Act’s provisions.






Implementation:
The ESMA is a law made by the Parliament of India under List No. 33 in Concurrent List of 7th Schedule of Constitution of India.
Although it is a very powerful law, its execution rests entirely on the discretion of the State government. Each state in the union of India, hence has a separate state Essential Services Maintenance Act with slight variations from the central law in its provisions. This freedom is accorded by the central law itself.
What is Esma?
This expression is bandied about whenever there is a major strike or bandh. It is the acronym
of a law, Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma), which the government can invoke to prohibit striking employees from refusing to work in certain essential services, which are necessary for the maintenance of normal life in the country.
What are essential services?
Any service with respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws or the government feels that its discontinuation would affect the maintenance of supplies and services necessary for sustaining life is considered an essential service.
Which services fall under this category?
Services related to public conservancy, sanitation, water supply, hospitals or related with the defence of the country are considered essential. Any establishment dealing with production, supply or distribution of petroleum, coal, power, steel and fertilizers also falls under the essential services category. Apart from this, any service in connection with banking can be subject to Esma. Communication and transport services and any government undertaking related to the purchase and distribution of food grains are also subject to this act. The employees can't even refuse to work overtime if their work is considered necessary for the maintenance of any of the essential services.
Is it illegal for these employees to go on strike?
A strike per se is not illegal, but the government is empowered to prohibit it if it feels that the strike is gravely disturbing public life. For that, the government has to issue a general or special order to end the strike. Any strike becomes illegal after the passing of this order.
What actions can be taken against the employees?
Persons who commence the strike as well as those who instigate it are liable to disciplinary action, which may include dismissal. As the strike becomes illegal after Esma is invoked, legal action can also be taken against these employees. Any police officer is empowered to arrest the striking persons without a warrant. Persons participating in or instigating the strike are punishable with imprisonment, which may extend to one year or with fine or with






both.
What is the Essential Commodity Act?
The Essential Commodity Act empowers the government to control production, supply and distribution of certain commodities. The act is aimed at maintaining or increasing supplies and for securing the equitable distribution and fair price availability of these commodities. The act is also intended to work against unethical trade practices like hoarding and black marketing.

55Q Consider the following statements regarding Anti Defection Law
1. The Tenth Schedule was inserted in the Constitution by the 91st Amendment Act.
2. Anti-Defection Law does not apply if an independent candidate, joins a party within six months of becoming a member of the legislature.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
What is the Anti Defection Law?
Context:
India’s first Member of Parliament to have been disqualified from the Lok Sabha has now been disqualified as an MLA in Mizoram.
Mizoram Assembly Speaker disqualifies Zoram People’s Movement MLA Lalduhoma.
Ground for disqualification:
The disqualification was on the ground that Mr. Lalduhoma had declared himself as a representative of the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) despite being elected as an independent candidate from the Serchhip Assembly constituency.
He lost the character of an independent legislator because of the declaration.






What is the anti-defection law?
The Tenth Schedule was inserted in the Constitution in 1985 by the 52nd Amendment Act. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
It lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection by the Presiding Officer of a legislature based on a petition by any other member of the House.
The law applies to both Parliament and state assemblies.
When can a member be disqualified?

If a member of a house belonging to a political party:
1. Voluntarily gives up the membership of his political party, or
2. Votes, or does not vote in the legislature, contrary to the directions of his political party. However, if the member has taken prior permission, or is condoned by the party within 15 days from such voting or abstention, the member shall not be disqualified.
3. If an independent candidate joins a political party after the election. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
4. If a nominated member joins a party six months after he becomes a member of the legislature.
However, Legislators may change their party without the risk of disqualification in certain circumstances:
1. The law allows a party to merge with or into another party provided that at least two thirds of its legislators are in favour of the merger.
2. In such a scenario, neither the members who decide to merge, nor the ones who stay with the original party will face disqualification.
Decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to judicial review:
The law initially stated that the decision of the Presiding Officer is not subject to judicial review. This condition was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1992, thereby allowing






appeals against the Presiding Officer’s decision in the High Court and Supreme Court.
However, it held that there may not be any judicial intervention until the Presiding Officer gives his order.

56Q Consider the following statements regarding genetically modified (GM) crops
1. The first-generation GM crops have improved traits like Herbicide-resistant crops (soybeans and maize, Pest resistance (Cotton and corn).

2. Second-generation GM crops involve enhanced quality traits, such as higher nutrient content. 3. In India, Bt cotton was the first transgenic crop allowed for commercial cultivation.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
Plant genetic engineering methods were developed over 30 years ago, and since then, genetically modified (GM) crops or transgenic crops have become commercially available and widely adopted in many countries.
The first-generation GM crops have improved traits like Herbicide-resistant crops (soybeans and maize, Pest resistance (Cotton and corn). Second-generation GM crops involve enhanced quality traits, such as higher nutrient content. “Golden Rice,” one of the very first GM crops, is biofortified to address vitamin A deficiency. Other biofortification projects include corn, sorghum, cassava, and banana plants, with enhanced minerals and vitamins. Crops can also be modified to ward off plant viruses or fungi. Even though the seed is more expensive, these GM crops lower the costs of production by reducing inputs of machinery, fuel, and chemical pesticides. Important environmental benefits, such as controlling farm runoff that otherwise pollutes water systems, are associated with reduced spraying of chemical insecticides and highly toxic herbicides.
In India, Bt cotton was approved by Government of India in March 2002 as the first transgenic crop for commercial cultivation for a period of three years. Apart from






cotton, there are more than 20 crops under research and development in about 50 public and private sector organizations in India. Out of these, 13 crops have been approved for contained limited field trials in India.
57Q Consider the following statements regarding Sericulture in India
1. North East has the unique distinction of being the only region producing four varieties of silk viz., Mulberry, Oak Tasar, Muga and Eri.
2. Overall North East region contributes 48% of India's total silk production. 3. Mulberry with its golden yellow glitter is unique and prerogative of India.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Silk production in India
India has the unique distinction of being the only country producing all the five known commercial silks, namely, mulberry, tropical tasar, oak tasar, eri and muga, of which muga with its golden yellow glitter is unique and prerogative of India. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
Mulberry sericulture is mainly practised in five states namely, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Bodoland, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu are major silk producing states in the country. North East has the unique distinction of being the only region producing four varieties of silk viz., Mulberry, Oak Tasar, Muga and Eri. Overall NE region contributes 18% of India's total silk production. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
India is the second largest producer of silk in the world. Among the four varieties of silk produced in 2015-16, Mulberry accounts for 71.8% (20,434 MT), Tasar 9.9% (2,818 MT), Eri 17.8% (5,054 MT) and Muga 0.6% (166 MT) of the total raw silk production of 28,472 MT.

2. India has the largest land area under irrigation.
3. India is the largest producer of agrochemicals.
Which of the statements given above are correct?
Agriculture contributes to about 15% of GDP and is a primary livelihood source for more than






50% of Indian population. Indian agriculture has several credits to it such as the following.
World’s largest producer of spices, pulses, milk, tea, cashew, jute, bananas, jackfruits, etc.
Second largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane, cotton and oilseeds
Fourth largest producer of agrochemicals. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
Largest livestock population of around 535.8 million (31%) of world's livestock
Largest land area under irrigation
Top five net exporters in the world
There is immense potential for export of commodities of Agriculture and its allied activities. Institutions like The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Commodity boards like Coffee Board, Rubber Board, Spices Board, etc. are mandated to promote the export of various Agriculture related commodities.
60Q Which of the following are the benefits of drip Irrigation?
1. Increase in yield up to 230 %.
2. Saves water up to 70% compare to flood irrigation.
3. Fertilizer use efficiency increases by 30%.
4. Drip irrigation application uniformity is very high, usually over 90%.
Select the correct answer using the code given below:
All the above statements are correct.






Benefits of drip Irrigation
Increase in yield up to 230 %.
Saves water up to 70% compare to flood irrigation. More land can be irrigated with the water thus saved.
Crop grows consistently, healthier and matures fast.
Early maturity results in higher and faster returns on investment.

Fertilizer use efficiency increases by 30%.
Cost of fertilizers, inter-culturing and labour use gets reduced.
Fertilizer and Chemical Treatment can be given through Micro Irrigation System itself.
Undulating terrains, Saline, Water logged, Sandy & Hilly lands can also be brought under productive cultivation.
Water conservation through drip
Water is conserved in the following ways:
Drip irrigation application uniformity is very high, usually over 90%.
Unlike sprinklers, drip irrigation applies water directly to the soil, eliminating water loss from wind.
Application rates are low so water may be spoon fed to the crop or plant root zone in the exact amounts required (even on a daily or hourly basis). In contrast, other methods entail higher water application quantities and less frequency. If young plants need water frequently, much of the water applied is often wasted to deep percolation or runoff.
Low application rates are less likely to run off from heavier soils or sloping terrain.
Drip irrigation does not water non-targeted areas such as furrows and roads in agriculture, between beds, blocks or benches in greenhouses, or hardscape, buildings or






roads in landscape.
Drip irrigation easily adapts to odd-shaped planting areas which are difficult to address with sprinklers or gravity irrigation.
Drip irrigation is capable of germinating seeds and setting transplants which eliminates the need for "sprinklering up" and eliminates the resulting waste in the early stages of crop growth.
Drip irrigation is today's need because Water - nature's gift to mankind is not unlimited and free forever. World water resources are fast diminishing.

66Q Which of the following are the tributaries of River Brahmaputra?
1. Manas
2. Kameng
3. Shiger
4. Subansiri
Select the correct answer using the code given below:
The Brahmaputra receives numerous tributaries in its 750 km long journey through the Assam valley. Its major left bank tributaries are the Burhi Dihing and Dhansari (South) whereas the important right bank tributaries are the Subansiri, Kameng, Manas and Sankosh. The Subansiri which has its origin in Tibet, is an antecedent river. The Brahmaputra enters into Bangladesh near Dhubri and flows southward. In Bangladesh, the Tista joins it on its right bank from where the river is known as the Jamuna. It finally merges with the river Padma, which falls in the Bay of Bengal. The Brahmaputra is well-known for floods, channel shifting and bank erosion. This is due to the fact that most of its tributaries are large, and bring large quantity of sediments owing to heavy rainfall in its catchment area.






The Gilgit, Gartang, Dras, Shiger, Hunza are the Himalayan tributaries of the Indus. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
China to build a major dam on Brahmaputra River:
Context:
Amid simmering border tension with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh, China is planning to build a major hydropower project on Brahmaputra River in Tibet and a proposal for this has been clearly put forward in the 14th Five-Year Plan to be implemented from next year.
Response from India and Bangladesh:
Proposals for dams on the Brahmaputra have evoked concerns in India and Bangladesh, the
riparian states, and China has downplayed such anxieties saying it would keep their interests in mind.
What are India’s concerns?
1. China’s dam building overdrive is a concern because there are no bilateral or multilateral treaties on the water.
2. China believes dam building on the Brahmaputra helps it assert claim over Arunachal Pradesh.
3. India believes China’s projects in the Tibetan plateau threaten to reduce river flows into India.
4. Dams, canals, irrigation systems can turn water into a political weapon to be wielded in war, or during peace to signal annoyance with a co-riparian state.
5. Denial of hydrological data becomes critical when the flow in the river is very high. 6. China is contemplating northward re-routing of the Yarlung Zangbo.
7. Diversion of the Brahmaputra is an idea China does not discuss in public, because it implies devastating India’s northeastern plains and Bangladesh, either with floods or reduced water flow.
Significance of Brahmaputra river for India:
The Brahmaputra flows for over 3,000km through Tibet, India and Bangladesh.
It is crucial for India too as its basin is a critical water source for Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Nagaland and West Bengal.
The Brahmaputra valley supports the lives of several indigenous communities.

68Q Consider the following statements regarding role of women in agriculture
1. As per Census 2011, out of total female main workers, 55 per cent were cultivators. 2. As per Census 2011, about 13 per cent of the operational holdings were owned by women.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Role of women in agriculture and its allied fields
Women play a significant and crucial role in agricultural development and allied fields. The nature and extent of women's involvement in agriculture varies greatly from region to region. But regardless of these variations, women are actively involved in various agricultural activities.
As per Census 2011, out of total female main workers, 55 per cent were agricultural labourers and 24 per cent were cultivators.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.






However, only 12.8 per cent of the operational holdings were owned by women, which reflect the gender disparity in ownership of landholdings in agriculture. Moreover, there is concentration of operational holdings (25.7 per cent) by women in the marginal and small holdings categories.
Rural women perform numerous labour intensive jobs such as weeding, hoeing, grass cutting, picking, cotton stick collection, separation of seeds from fibre, keeping of livestock and its other associated activities like milking, milk processing, preparation of ghee, etc.
Feminisation of Agriculture
Economic Survey 2017-18 says that with growing rural to urban migration by men, there is ‘feminisation’ of agriculture sector, with increasing number of women in multiple roles as cultivators, entrepreneurs, and labourers. Globally, there is empirical evidence that women
have a decisive role in ensuring food security and preserving local agro-biodiversity. Rural women are responsible for the integrated management and use of diverse natural resources to meet the daily household needs. This requires that women farmers should have enhanced access to resources like land, water, credit, technology and training which warrants critical analysis in the context of India. In addition, the entitlements of women farmers will be the key to improve agriculture productivity. The differential access of women to resources like land, credit, water, seeds and markets needs to be addressed.
With women predominant at all levels-production, pre-harvest, post-harvest processing, packaging, marketing – of the agricultural value chain, to increase productivity in agriculture, it is imperative to adopt gender specific interventions. An ‘inclusive transformative agricultural policy’ should aim at gender-specific intervention to raise productivity of small farm holdings, integrate women as active agents in rural transformation, and engage men and women in extension services with gender expertise.
69Q Consider the following statements regarding status of marine fisheries in India
1. Presently India is the second largest fish producing and second largest aquaculture nation in the world after Japan.
2. Out of the total crafts fully owned by fisherfolk, 53% were motorized.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?






Status of marine fisheries in India
Fisheries is an important sector in India. It provides employment to millions of people and contributes to food security of the country. With a coastline of over 8,000 km, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over 2 million sq km, and with extensive freshwater resources, fisheries play a vital role. The gross value addition of the fisheries and aquaculture sector during 2016-17 was Rs. 1,33,492 Crores which is about 0.96% of the National Gross Value Added (GVA) and 5.37% to the agricultural GVA (2016-17). During the year 2017-18, the country has exported 13,77,244 tonnes fish and fisheries products worth Rs. 45106.89 crore (7.08 billion US $).
Presently India is the second largest fish producing and second largest aquaculture nation in the world after China.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.

The total fish production during 2017-18 (provisional) is registered at 12.61 million metric tonnes (MMT) with a contribution of 8.92 MMT from inland sector and 3.69 MMT from marine sector.
The marine fishery potential in the Indian waters have been estimated at 5.31 MMT constituting about 43.3% demersal, 49.5% pelagic and 4.3% oceanic groups.
Marine Fisheries contributes to food security and provides direct employment to over 1.5 mn fisher people besides others indirectly dependent on the sector. There are 3,432 marine fishing villages and 1,537 notified fish landing centres in 9 maritime states and 2 union territories.
According to the CMFRI Census 2010, the total marine fisherfolk population was about 4 million comprising in 864,550 families. Nearly 61% of the fishermen families were under BPL category. The average family size was 4.63 and the overall sex ratio was 928 females per 1000 males. The Indian coastline can be delineated into 22 zones, based on the ecosystem structure and functions. The Indian boat type ranges from the traditional catamarans, masula boats, plank-built boats, dugout canoes, machwas, dhonis to the present day motorized fibre-glass boats, mechanized trawlers and gillnetters. In the marine fisheries sector, there were 194,490 crafts in the fishery out of which 37% were mechanized, 37% were motorized and 26% were non-motorized. Out of a total of 167,957 crafts fully owned by fisherfolk 53% were non motorized, 24% were motorized and 23% were mechanized.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Among the mechanized crafts fully owned by fishermen, 29% were trawlers, 43% were gillnetters and 19% were dolnetters.
70Q Which of the following currencies are used in Special drawing rights (SDR)?
1. Euro
2. Chinese Yuan
3. Japanese Yen
4. Pound Sterling





Select the correct answer using the code given below: A. 1, 2 and 3 only
What Are Special Drawing Rights (SDR)?


Special drawing rights (SDR) refer to an international type of monetary reserve currency
created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1969 that operates as a supplement to the existing money reserves of member countries. Created in response to concerns about the limitations of gold and dollars as the sole means of settling international accounts, SDRs augment international liquidity by supplementing the standard reserve currencies.
Key Takeaways
Special drawing rights (SDR) are an artificial currency instrument created by the International Monetary Fund, which uses them for internal accounting purposes. The value of the SDR is calculated from a weighted basket of major currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound.
The SDR interest rate (SDRi) provides the basis for calculating the interest rate charged to member countries when they borrow from the IMF and paid to members for their remunerated creditor positions in the IMF.
All the above are correct.
Understanding Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
An SDR is essentially an artificial currency instrument used by the IMF and is built from a basket of important national currencies. The IMF uses SDRs for internal accounting purposes. SDRs are allocated by the IMF to its member countries and are backed by the full faith and credit of the member countries' governments. The makeup of the SDR is re-evaluated every five years. The current makeup of the SDR is represented by the following table:
Currency Weights Determined in the
Fixed Number of Units of Currency for
2015 Review
a 5-Year Period Starting Oct. 1, 2016
U.S. Dollar 41.73 0.58252
Euro 30.93 0.38671
Chinese Yuan 10.92 1.0174
Japanese Yen 8.33 11.900
Pound Sterling 8.09 0.085946









71Q Consider the following statements regarding Reserve Tranche
1. It is a portion of the required quota of currency each member country must provide to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that can be utilized for its own purposes. 2. It is basically an emergency account that IMF members can access at any time, but agreeing to conditions or by paying a service fee.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
What Is a Reserve Tranche?
A reserve tranche is a portion of the required quota of currency each member country must provide to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that can be utilized for its own purposes—without a service fee or economic reform conditions.
Reserve Tranche Explained
The IMF is funded through its members and their quota contributions. The reserve tranche is basically an emergency account that IMF members can access at any time without agreeing to conditions or paying a service fee. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
In other words, a portion of a member country’s quota can be withdrawn free of charge at its own discretion.
Key Takeaways
The reserve tranche is a segment of an International Monetary Fund member country’s quota that is accessible without fees or economic reform conditions.
Initially, member nations’ reserve tranches are 25% of their quota, but this position can change according to any lending that the IMF does with its holdings of the member’s currency.
The reserve tranches that countries hold with the IMF are considered their facilities of first resort, meaning they will tap into them before seeking a formal credit tranche that charges interest.
Reserve Tranche Requirements






In theory, members can borrow over 100% of their quota. However, if the amount being sought by the member nation exceeds its reserve tranche position (RTP), then it becomes a credit tranche that must be repaid in three years with interest. The first 25% reserve tranche portion charges no interest. Anything beyond that could require permission and be subject to a service fee.
Initially, member nations’ reserve tranches are 25% of their quota. However, their reserve tranche position can change according to any lending that the IMF does with its holdings of the member’s currency.
72Q One Health approach focuses on
1. Food safety

2. Control of zoonoses
3. Antibiotic resistance
Which of the statements given above are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
What is 'One Health'?
'One Health' is an approach to designing and implementing programmes, policies, legislation and research in which multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes.
The areas of work in which a One Health approach is particularly relevant include food safety, the control of zoonoses (diseases that can spread between animals and humans, such as flu, rabies and Rift Valley Fever), and combatting antibiotic resistance (when bacteria change after being exposed to antibiotics and become more difficult to treat).
Why do we need a One Health approach?
Many of the same microbes infect animals and humans, as they share the eco-systems they live in. Efforts by just one sector cannot prevent or eliminate the problem. For instance, rabies in humans is effectively prevented only by targeting the animal source of the virus (for example, by vaccinating dogs).
Information on influenza viruses circulating in animals is crucial to the selection of viruses for






human vaccines for potential influenza pandemics. Drug-resistant microbes can be transmitted between animals and humans through direct contact between animals and humans or through contaminated food, so to effectively contain it, a well-coordinated approach in humans and in animals is required.
Who makes the One Health approach work?
Many professionals with a range of expertise who are active in different sectors, such as public health, animal health, plant health and the environment, should join forces to support One Health approaches.
To effectively detect, respond to, and prevent outbreaks of zoonoses and food safety problems, epidemiological data and laboratory information should be shared across sectors. Government officials, researchers and workers across sectors at the local, national, regional and global levels should implement joint responses to health threats.

WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to promote multi-sectoral responses to food safety hazards, risks from zoonoses, and other public health threats at the human-animal ecosystem interface and provide guidance on how to reduce these risks.

1. It is a mission operated by the Japanese space agency, JAXA.
2. It is a mission to bring samples of the soil of asteroid Bennu.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?






Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft carrying asteroid soil samples nears Earth: Context:

Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft left the asteroid Ryugu a year ago and is expected to reach Earth and drop a capsule containing the precious samples in southern Australia on December 6. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
The soil samples and data from the asteroid could provide clues to the origins of the solar system.
Hayabusa2 project:
It is an asteroid sample-return missionoperated by the Japanese space agency, JAXA. It was launched on 3 December 2014 and rendezvoused with Ryugu on 27 June 2018.
It carried multiple science payloads for remote sensing, sampling, and four small rovers that will investigate the asteroid surface to inform the environmental and geological context of the samples collected
The scientific objectives of Hayabusa2 mission are twofold:
1. To characterize the asteroid from remote sensing observations (with multispectral cameras, near-infrared spectrometer, thermal infrared imager, laser altimeter) on a macroscopic scale
2. To analyse the samples returned from the asteroid on a microscopic scale. What is the significance of the mission?
Ryugu is a C-type asteroid – a relic from the early days of the Solar System. Scientists think that C-type asteroids contain both organic matter, and trapped water, and might have been responsible for bringing both to Earth, thereby providing the planet with the materials necessary for life to originate.

An anti-dumping duty is a protectionist tariff that a domestic government imposes on foreign imports that it believes are priced below fair market value. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.






What Are Countervailing Duties?
Countervailing Duties (CVDs) are tariffs levied on imported goods to offset subsidies made to producers of these goods in the exporting country. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
CVDs are meant to level the playing field between domestic producers of a product and foreign producers of the same product who can afford to sell it at a lower price because of the subsidy they receive from their government.
The duty nullifies and eliminates the price advantage (low price) enjoyed by an imported product when it is given subsidies or exempted from domestic taxes in the country where they are manufactured.

The duty raises the price of the imported product, bringing it closer to its true market price. In this way, the government is able to provide a level playing field for domestic products.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) permits the imposition of countervailing duty by its member countries.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
In India, the CVD is imposed as an additional duty besides customs on imported products when such products are given tax concession in the country of their origin.
The levy of anti-dumping duty is both exporter-specific and country-specific. It extends to the imports from only that country in respect of which dumping has been alleged and the complaint has been filed and duty recommended. Such duty does not apply to imports from other countries in respect of which the domestic industry has not alleged dumping.
Who imposes countervailing measures in India?
The countervailing measures in India are administered by the Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD), in the commerce and industry ministry’s department of commerce. While the department of commerce recommends anti-dumping duty, provisional or final, it is the department of revenue in the finance ministry that acts upon the recommendation within three months and imposes such duties.

1. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is when a company takes controlling ownership in a business entity in another country.
2. FDI is an important source of debt finance for the economic development of India. 3. Under the Housing and Real Estate sector, FDI is allowed under Automatic route.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is when a company takes controlling ownership in a business entity in another country.With FDI, foreign companies are directly involved with day-to-day operations in the other country. This means they aren’t just bringing money with them, but also knowledge, skills and technology.
Generally, FDI takes place when an investor establishes foreign business operations or acquires foreign business assets, including establishing ownership or controlling interest in a foreign company.
FDI is a major driver of economic growth and an important source of non-debt
finance for the economic development of India.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect. Where is FDI made?
Foreign Direct Investments are commonly made in open economies that have skilled workforce and growth prospect. FDIs not only bring money with them but also skills, technology and knowledge.
FDI in India
FDI is an important monetary source for India's economic development. Economic liberalisation started in India in the wake of the 1991 crisis and since then, FDI has steadily increased in the country. India, today is a part of top 100-club on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) and globally ranks number 1 in the greenfield FDI ranking.
Routes through which India gets FDI
Automatic route: The non-resident or Indian company does not require prior nod of the RBI or government of India for FDI.
Govt route: The government's approval is mandatory. The company will have to file an application through Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal, which facilitates single-window clearance. The application is then forwarded to the respective ministry, which will approve/reject the application in consultation with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce. DPIIT will issue the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for processing of applications under the existing FDI policy.
FDI prohibition
There are a few industries where FDI is strictly prohibited under any route. These industries are
Atomic Energy Generation
Any Gambling or Betting businesses
Lotteries (online, private, government, etc)






Investment in Chit Funds
Nidhi Company
Agricultural or Plantation Activities (although there are many exceptions like horticulture, fisheries, tea plantations, Pisciculture, animal husbandry, etc) Housing and Real Estate (except townships, commercial projects, etc) Trading in TDR’s
Cigars, Cigarettes, or any related tobacco industry
Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.
80Q Consider the following statements regarding Purchasing Managers’ Index

Started in 1948 by the US-based Institute of Supply Management, the Purchasing Managers’ Index, or PMI (https://m.economictimes.com/topic/PMI), has now become one of the most closely watched indicators of business activity across the world. ET explains how the index works and what it means:
What is a PMI?
PMI or a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is an indicator of business activity -- both in the manufacturing and services sectors. Hence, option (b) is correct.
It is a survey-based measures that asks the respondents about changes in their perception of some key business variables from the month before. It is calculated separately for the manufacturing and services sectors and then a composite index is constructed.
How is the PMI derived?
The PMI is derived from a series of qualitative questions. Executives from a reasonably big sample, running into hundreds of firms, are asked whether key indicators such as output, new orders, business expectations and employment were stronger than the month before and are asked to rate them.
How does one read the PMI?






A figure above 50 denotes expansion in business activity. Anything below 50 denotes contraction. Higher the difference from this mid-point greater the expansion or contraction. The rate of expansion can also be judged by comparing the PMI with that of the previous month data. If the figure is higher than the previous month’s then the econ-omy is expanding at a faster rate. If it is lower than the previous month then it is growing at a lower rate.
What are its implications for the economy?
The PMI is usually released at the start of the month, much before most of the official data on industrial output, manufacturing and GDP growth becomes available. It is, therefore, considered a good leading indicator of economic activity. Economists consider the manufacturing growth measured by the PMI as a good indicator of industrial output, for which official statistics are released later. Central banks of many countries also use the index to help make decisions on interest rates.

81Q Consider the following statements regarding Green Charcoal Hackathon
1. The initiative was launched by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
2. The purpose of the event is to bridge the technology gap with the objective to clean the air by eliminating farm fire and producing renewable energy out of the agro residue.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Green Charcoal Hackathon:
Launched by NVVN (NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam), a wholly-owned subsidiary company of NTPC Ltd.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
It is a technology challenge with an aim to fast-track technology developments conducted by NVVN in partnership with EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Ltd).
The purpose of the event is to leverage the innovative Indian mind to bridge the technology gap, with the prime objective to:
1. Clean the air by eliminating farm fire, producing renewable energy out of the agro residue.






2. Promote local entrepreneurship.
3. Increase the income of the farmers.
The ultimate goals is to reduce the carbon footprint of the nation.
Shri R.K.Singh, the Union Minister of State(I/C) for Power and New & RE, was speaking with a vision to create a conducive environment by reducing carbon emissions and nurture technology solutions in India. NVVN (NTPC VidyutVyapar Nigam), a wholly-owned subsidiary company of NTPC Ltd, today launched the Green Charcoal Hackathon.
To fast-track the technology development, NVVN, in partnership with EESL organises technology challenge aptly named as Green Charcoal Hackathon. The purpose of the event is to leverage the innovative Indian mind to bridge the technology gap, with the prime objective to clean the air by eliminating farm fire, producing renewable energy
out of the agro residue, to promote local entrepreneurship, and to increase the income of the farmers.
The increasing air pollution due to the burning of stubble and agro residue by local farmers has become a major concern for the country. As a result, NVVN is looking for technologies to convert the agricultural waste to a form that can be used in the power plants in form of the Green Charcoal Hackathon. One such option is torrefaction which converts the agro residue to green charcoal.
The technology to produce torrefied fuel using agro residue biomass is not easily accessible to small entrepreneurs due to the higher cost of imported machines, lack of sufficient manufacturers. The technology to produce torrefied fuel using agro residue biomass once developed in India will be made accessible to small entrepreneurs.
To encourage the participants, there was a provision for cash prizes worth up to INR 24 Lakhs* in three Categories, namely:
a) Category – I, Technology for Production of 100 kg per day of Torrefied Biomass Pellets
b) Category – II, Technology for Production of 1000 kg per day of Torrefied Biomass Pellets
c) Category – III, Technology for Production of 10 Tonnes per day of Torrefied Biomass Pellets

82Q Consider the following statements regarding Foreign institutional investors (FIIs)
1. Each FII or sub-account of an FII has been permitted to invest upto 10% of the equity of any one company, subject to the overall limit of 50% on investments by all FIIs, NRIs and OCBs. 2. FII’s in India are regulated by Reserve Bank of India.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?






Definition: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are those institutional investors which invest in the assets belonging to a different country other than that where these organizations are based.

Description: Foreign institutional investors play a very important role in any economy. These are the big companies such as investment banks, mutual funds etc, who invest considerable amount of money in the Indian markets. With the buying of securities by these big players, markets trend to move upward and vice-versa. They exert strong influence on the total inflows coming into the economy.
Market regulator SEBI has over 1450 foreign institutional investors registered with it. The FIIs are considered as both a trigger and a catalyst for the market performance by encouraging investment from all classes of investors which further leads to growth in financial market trends under a self-organized system. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
In 1996-97, several changes have been made to the SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 to diversify the foreign institutional investor base and to further facilitate inflow of foreign portfolio investment. The changes have also aimed at facilitating investment in debt securities through the FII route. The changes are as follows:
the eligible categories of FIIs have been expanded to include university funds, endowments, foundations, charitable trusts and charitable societies which have a track record of 5 years and which are registered with a statutory authority in their country of incorporation or establishment
each FII or sub-account of an FII has been permitted to invest upto 10% of the equity of any one company, subject to the overall limit of 24% on investments by all FIIs, NRIs and OCBs.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
the 24% limit may be raised to 30% in the case of individual companies who have obtained shareholder approval for the same
FIIs have been permitted to invest in unlisted securities
FIIs have been allowed to invest their proprietary funds
FIIs who obtain specific approval from SEBI have been permitted to invest 100% of their portfolios in debt securities. Such investment may be in listed or to be listed corporate debt securities or in dated government securities, and is treated to be part of the overall limit on external commercial borrowing.






83Q Consider the following statements regarding WTO and Agricultural subsidies
1. The subsidies which are supposed to distort production and trade fall into the amber box. 2. There is 5 per cent and 10 per cent limit for the developed and the developing countries, respectively, on spending on subsidies in the blue box.
3. The agricultural subsidies which cause minimal or no distortions to trade are put under the green box.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
WTO And Agricultural subsidies
The subsidies provided by the government to the agricultural sector (i.e., domestic support) is termed by the WTO as Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS).It is calculated in terms of product and input subsidies. The WTO argues that the product subsidies like minimum support prices and input subsidies (non-product) like credit, fertilizers, irrigation and power will cut production cost of farming and will give undue advantage to such countries in their access to the world market—such subsidies are called to cause ‘distortions’ to the world trade. Such subsidies are not permitted in one sense as they have a minimum permissible limit de minimis under the provisions which is 5 per cent and 10 per cent of their total agricultural output in the case of developed and developing countries, respectively.
Amber box
All subsidies which are supposed to distort production and trade fall into the amber box, i.e., all agricultural subsidies except those which fall into the blue and green boxes.These include government policies of minimum support prices (as MSP in India) for agricultural products or any help directly related to production quantities (as power, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, etc).
Under the WTO provisions, these subsidies are subject to reduction commitment to their minimum level—to 5 per cent and 10 per cent for the developed and the developing countries, respectively, of their total value of agricultural outputs, per annum accordingly.
blue box
This is the amber box with conditions. The conditions are designed to reduce distortions. Any subsidy that would normally be in the amber box, is placed in the blue box if it requires






farmers to go for a certain production level.These subsidies are nothing but certain direct payments (i.e., direct set-aside payments) made to farmers by the government in the form of assistance programmes to encourage agriculture, rural development, etc.
At present there are no limits on spending on subsidies in the blue box.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
green box
The agricultural subsidies which cause minimal or no distortions to trade are put under the green box.They must not involve price support. This box basically includes all forms of government expenses, which are not targeted at a particular product, and all direct income support programmes to farmers, which are not related to current levels of production or prices.

The green box subsidies are allowed without limits provided they comply with the policy specific criteria.
84Q Consider the following statements regarding Food processing sector
1. 100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route in Food processing industries. 2. It has about 11% Share in total employment and about 11% Share in India's exports.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
Food processing - 'A sunrise sector'
India's food ecosystem offers huge opportunities for investments with stimulating growth in the food retail sector, favourable economic policies and attractive fiscal incentives. The Food & Grocery market in India is the sixth largest in the world. Food & Grocery retail market in India further constitutes almost 65% of the total retail market in India.
The Government of India through the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is also taking all necessary steps to boost investments in the food processing industry. The government has sanctioned 37 food parks funded under the Mega Food Parks Scheme, 20 are operational and 17 are under implementation as on 29th Oct 2020.






32% Share in India's food market
11.6% Share in total employment
10.7% Share in India's exports
142% Cropping intensity
By 2024, the Food Processing industry will potentially attract $33 bn investments and generate employment for 9 million people
By 2025, India’s food processing sector is expected to be worth over half a trillion dollars By 2030, Indian annual household consumption to treble, making India 5th largest consumer
100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route in Food processing industries.
100% FDI is allowed through government approval route for trading, including through e commerce in respect of food products manufactured or produced in India.

The food processing sector is growing at an average annual growth rate of more than 5 per cent over the last six years ending 2017-18, more focussed attention to the sector is required due to its significant role in reducing post-harvest losses and creation of additional market for farm outputs.
85Q An increase in Current Account Deficit as a ratio to GDP can lead to
1. Worsening of Balance of Payment, by drawing down forex reserves.
2. Building the potential to worsen Balance of Payment by increasing the external debt burden.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
An increase in CAD as a ratio to GDP worsens the BoP by drawing down on forex reserves or building the potential to worsen it by increasing the external debt burden. Yet that has not been the case with CAD to GDP ratio significantly improving from 2009-14 to 2014-19.








The backup to CAD is the forex reserves with increase in CAD/forex ratio reflecting the decreasing strength of the backup. The decreasing strength spills into depreciating the currency. The ratio increased from 10.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 13.9 per cent in 2018-19 and depreciated the rupee.
86Q Consider the following statements regarding Merchandise trade
1. Merchandise trade deficit is the largest component of India’s current account deficit. 2. With USA and United Arab Emirates, India has consistently run trade deficit since 2014-15.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Merchandise Exports
An increase in merchandise exports to GDP ratio has a net positive impact on BOP position.Over the years the merchandise exports to GDP ratio has been declining, entailing a negative impact on the BoP position (Table 4 and Figure 6).Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.








Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) exports have a dominant share in India’s export basket.











88Q Consider the following statements regarding Services sector
1. India’s net services surplus has been steadily declining in relation to GDP 2. An increase in service imports to GDP ratio has a net positive impact on the BoP position.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Net Services
Net services as a proportion of GDP reflects the net impact of service exports and imports on BoP. India’s net services surplus has been steadily declining in relation to GDP (Table 12 and Figure 18).









The surplus on net services has been significantly financing the merchandise trade deficit. The financing reached its peak to about two-thirds of merchandise deficit in 2016-17 before declining to less than half in the last couple of years (Figure 19). Given a steady decline in net services to GDP ratio, the extent of financing will steadily fall unless merchandise trade deficit improves in relation to GDP.
Service Imports
An increase in service imports to GDP ratio has a net negative impact on the BoP position.Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
Over the years, service imports in relation to GDP has been steadily rising putting pressure on BoP to worsen (Table 14 and Figure 22). However, increase in service imports to GDP ratio is inevitable given a rising level of FDI and a gradual upscaling of the Make in India program.









89Q Which of the following is the largest component of service imports?










The relative shares of the various constituents of service imports have also not varied much with business services constituting about a third of service imports, which is in consonance with the rising level of economic activity in the country. The component of travel services has however been steadily increasing reflecting the growing attractiveness of global destinations to the domestic tourists in the country (Figure 23).
Hence, option (b) is correct.

94Q Consider the following statements regarding automated teller machine (ATM)
1. Brown Label ATMs (BLAs)are owned by third party and concerned banks only handle part of the process that is ‘cash handling’ and ‘back-end server’ connectivity.
2. White Label ATMs (WLAs) are ‘owned’ and ‘operated’ by a third party (a non-banking firm).
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
All the above statements are correct.
labels of ATM
The automated teller machine (ATM) entered India by late 1980s and have evolved into three of its types by now—
(i) Bank’s own ATMs: These are owned and operated by the concerned bank and carry the bank’s ‘logo’. They are the costliest way to provide such service to bank’s customers.
(ii) Brown Label ATMs (BLAs): These are owned by third party (a non-banking firm). The concerned banks only handle part of the process that is ‘cash handling’ and ‘back-end server’ connectivity. They carry ‘logo’ of the bank which outsources their






service.
(iii) White Label ATMs (WLAs): These are ‘owned’ and ‘operated’ by a third party (a non-banking firm). They do not bear ‘logo’ of the banks they serve (that is why such a name). In place, they carry logo of the firm which own them. They serve customers of all banks and are interconnected with the entire ATM network in the country. The role of the concerned bank is only limited to provide account information and back end money transfers to the third parties managing these ATM machines. These entities have a mandate to deploy 67 per cent of ATMs in rural locations (Tier III-VI) and 33 per cent in urban locations (Tier I and II cities).
95Q Consider the following statements regarding security markets

1. The market where the instruments of security market are traded among the primary instrument holders is known as the primary market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Every security market has two complementary markets—primary and the secondary. The market in which the instruments of security market are traded (procured) directly between the capital raiser and the instrument purchaser is known as the primary market.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
As for example, a share being directly purchased by anybody from the issuer which may be the company itself. The person is known as the primary shareholder. The market where the instruments of security market are traded among the primary instrument holders is known as the secondary market. Such transactions need an institutionalized floor for their trading which is made available by the stock exchanges.
World’s first stock exchange was established in Antwerp, Belgium (then part of the Netherlands) in 1631, the London Stock Exchange opened in 1773 and then Philadelphia Stock Exchange (the first in the New World) opened in 1790.The first stock exchange in India, the Bombay Stock Exchange known as The Native Share and StockBrokers’ Association was set up in 1870 (under a tree!).
The Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. (BSE), earlier a regional stock exchange, converted

What is Angel Tax?
Angel Tax is a 30% tax that is levied on the funding received by startups from an external investor. However, this 30% tax is levied when startups receive angel funding at a valuation higher than its ‘fair market value’. It is counted as income to the company and is taxed.
The tax, under section 56(2)(viib), was introduced by in 2012 to fight money laundering. The stated rationale was that bribes and commissions could be disguised as angel investments to escape taxes. But given the possibility of this section being used to harass genuine startups, it was rarely invoked.
Why is Angel tax problematic?
There is no definitive or objective way to measure the ‘fair market value’ of a startup. Investors pay a premium for the idea and the business potential at the angel funding stage. However, tax officials seem to be assessing the value of the startups based on their net asset value at one point. Several startups say that they find it difficult to justify the higher valuation






to tax officials.
In a notification dated May 24, 2018, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had exempted angel investors from the Angel Tax clause subject to fulfilment of certain terms and conditions, as specified by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) now renamed as the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. However, despite the exemption notification, there are a host of challenges that startups are still faced with, in order to get this exemption.
Proposed reforms:
1. Earlier, start-ups whose aggregate amount of paid-up share capital and share premium after the proposed issue of share does not exceed ₹10 crore are eligible for exemption from the tax. The government is planning to raise this limit to ₹25 crore.
2. It is also planning to amend the definition of a start-up to include companies that have been in operation for up to 10 years rather than the previous limit of seven years.
Is Scrapping Angel Tax possible?
The angel tax could not be scrapped as money laundering is a major problem. There is a network of 200 shell companies and they have been under control since 2012, so it cannot be scrapped.
However, concessions are under consideration with the size of the start-up, the duration of its operation, and the income of the angel investor.
97Q Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) is an agreement in negotiation by India with
Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA)
At the upcoming Virtual “EU- India Summit”, Leaders expected to give a kickstart to negotiations on the Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) as the EU-India FTA is known, which have failed to be resumed despite several commitments by the leaders, including at the last E.U.-India summit in 2017.Hence, option (d) is correct.
Challenges ahead:






Negotiators are still “quite far apart” due to what Europe perceives as India’s “protectionist stance”.
Besides, Make in India programme has been accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis and recent pronouncements that India wants to go ‘Self reliant’ has added to the situation.
India- EU trade:
Trade with India formed under 3% of the E.U.’s global trade, which is “far below” what was expected of the relationship.
Conversely, the E.U. is India’s largest trading partner and investor, and accounts for 11% of India’s global trade.
About BTIA:

In June 2007, India and the EU began negotiations on a broad-based Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) in Brussels, Belgium.
These negotiations are pursuant to the commitment made by political leaders at the 7th India-EU Summit held in Helsinki on 13th October 2006 to move towards negotiations for a broad-based trade and investment agreement on the basis of the report of India EU High Level Technical Group.
Significance:
India and the EU expect to promote bilateral trade by removing barriers to trade in goods and services and investment across all sectors of the economy.
Both parties believe that a comprehensive and ambitious agreement that is consistent with WTO rules and principles would open new markets and would expand opportunities for Indian and EU businesses.
The negotiations cover:
Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, Investment, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Technical Barriers to Trade, Trade Remedies, Rules of Origin, Customs and Trade Facilitation, Competition, Trade Defence, Government Procurement, Dispute Settlement, Intellectual Property Rights & Geographical Indications, Sustainable Development.
What’s the issue now?
Negotiations have been languishing since 2013 when the talks collapsed over certain demands from the EU such as greater market access for automobiles, wine and spirits, and further opening up of the financial services sector such as banking, insurance and e-commerce.
The EU also wanted labour, environment and government procurement to be included in the talks.






India’s demand for easier work visa and study visa norms as well as data secure status, that would make it easier for European companies to outsource business to India, were also not received enthusiastically by the EU countries.

98Q Consider the following statements regarding Agriculture and its allied sectors
1. Its contribution to national income has gradually declined from 18.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 16.5 in 2019-20.
2. The Gross Capital Formation (GCF) in agriculture and allied sectors relative to GVA has been consistently increasing over the past decade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Agriculture and its allied sectors still remain an important sector because of its continued role in employment, income and most importantly in national food security. Its contribution to national income has gradually declined from 18.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 16.5 in 2019-20, reflecting the development process and the structural transformation taking place in the economy.
The realisation of the objective of doubling farmer’s income requires that the challenges of the sector such as access to credit, insurance coverage, irrigation facilities, etc. are addressed. There is also a need to address the issue of lower farm mechanisation in India which is only about 40 per cent as compared to about 60 per cent in China and around 75 per cent in Brazil.
Gross Capital Formation (GCF) in Agriculture
The GCF in agriculture and allied sectors relative to GVA in this sector has been showing a fluctuating trend from 16.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 15.2 per cent in 2017-18 (Table 3). Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.








99Q Consider the following statements regarding Agricultural trade
1. India’s total agricultural export basket accounts for a little over 5.15 per cent of the world agricultural trade.
2. Since the economic reforms in 1991, India has remained consistently a net exporter of agri products.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
Agricultural trade
India occupies a leading position in global trade of agricultural products. However, its total agricultural export basket accounts for a little over 2.15 per cent of the world agricultural trade.Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
The major export destinations are USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nepal and Bangladesh. What is noteworthy is that since the economic reforms began in 1991, India has remained consistently a net exporter of agri-products, touching ` 2.7 lakh crore exports and imports at ` 1.37 lakh crore in 2018-19. The export of major agri-allied items for the last 3 years are given in Table 5.
